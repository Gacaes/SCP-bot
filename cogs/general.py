The object classes are as follows\nSafe: Object class safe is classified as any SCP that does not make an active effort to escape their containment and is nonhostile to site staff.\nEuclid: Euclid-class SCPs are anomalies that require more resources to contain completely or where containment isn't always reliable. Usually this is because the SCP is insufficiently understood or inherently unpredictable. Euclid is the Object Class with the greatest scope, and it's usually a safe bet that an SCP will be this class if it doesn't easily fall into any of the other standard Object Classes./nAs a note, any SCP that's autonomous, sentient and/or sapient is generally classified as Euclid, due to the inherent unpredictability of an object that can act or think on its own.\n Keter: Keter-class SCPs are anomalies that are exceedingly difficult to contain consistently or reliably, with containment procedures often being extensive and complex. The Foundation often can't contain these SCPs well due to not having a solid understanding of the anomaly, or lacking the technology to properly contain or counter it. A Keter SCP does not mean the SCP is dangerous, just that it is simply very difficult or costly to contain.\nThaumiel: Thaumiel-class SCPs are anomalies that the Foundation specifically uses to contain other SCPs. Even the mere existence of Thaumiel-class objects is classified at the highest levels of the Foundation and their locations, functions, and current status are known to few Foundation personnel outside of the O5 Council.\nNeutralized: Neutralized SCPs are anomalies that are no longer anomalous, either through having been intentionally or accidentally destroyed, or disabled.\nApollyon: Apollyon-class SCPs are anomalies that cannot be contained, are expected to breach containment imminently, or some other similar scenario. Such anomalies are usually associated with world-ending threats or a K-Class Scenario of some kind and require a massive effort from the Foundation to deal with.\nArchon: Archon-class SCPs are anomalies that could theoretically be contained but are best left uncontained for some reason. Archon SCPs may be a part of consensus reality that is difficult to fully contain or may have adverse effects if put into containment. These SCPs are not uncontainable—the defining feature of the class is that the Foundation chooses to not put the anomaly into containment.\nIf you have trouble remembering the class please refer to the locked box test:If you can lock it in a box and nothing happens it is Safe\nIf you lock it in a box and you are unaware of what might happen it is Euclid\nIf you lock it in a box and it escapes it is Keter\nIf it is the box it is Thaumiel\nIf you can't lock it in a box and it tries to end the world it is Apollyon\nIf you can lock it in a box but choose not to it is Archon.")

Always has long blond hair, glasses, patched jean jacket, and a single bone earring. Never seen in person; communicates via computer terminal.\nUsually presents as male, sometimes as female, sometimes non-binary/other. Never explains this. An informant suggested to me that it's a computer error; I find it hard to believe it's not on purpose.\nOriginal identity unknown. Various intelligence reports claim that he (?) is actually dead, and only exists in the computer matrices he created as an artificial intelligence. Excessively friendly in personality. Usually. A relatively active O5 member at certain Sites.\nAssorted rumors hold that O5-3 is the brother of SCP-2772 (probable), and may have helped invent the Internet in the 1960's (unknown).\nMay have never been human - possibly an artificial intelligence referred to in Foundation documentation as the \"All-seeing Eye\".\n\"The Swallowed Tail\" source connects \"The Kid\" with an image of dubious provenance depicting a Korean child, but regards this image with skepticism. True appearance of O5-3 unknown.\nO5-3 is reportedly the head of the Foundation's Recordkeeping and Information Security Administration, managing all of the Foundation's digital records. Appears to be capable of predicting future events, including extranormal ones. Is this just a matter of having all of the data, or are anomalous means being used?\n05-03: The Philosopher Scientist\nMale. East Asian descent. Japanese origin. Appears to be 60+ years old. Actual age unknown. No unusual appearance.\nJoined the O5 Council in in the 1930's, shortly after World War 1. Known for caring about the social ramifications of science; strongly opposed social Darwinism.\nGenerally a voice of caution; the conscience of the O5 Council, even if often overridden by other members, and even if often endorsing Foundation projects he does not fully agree with.\nHelped found the Ethics Committee. Possibly still plays a lead role in the organization (if it even exists).\nWhile already an O5 Council member, gained a PhD in clinical psychology. Was the original person responsible for implementing psychological checkups of Foundation personnel.\n05-03: The Beacon/nMale. European descent. American origin. Appears to be 50+ years old. Actual age unknown. Varying appearance.\nMade a lifelong study of various methods of controlling large groups of people. A particular fascination with religion and religious cults. Convinced by other O5 members to investigate making large groups of people profitable as well.O5-3 is particularly shrouded in myth. He is presented as a literal supernatural figure in some reports, and as a perfectly ordinary man in others. Ordinarily, this could be chalked up to religiously related manipulation, but as an O5 member, some claim to divine status cannot be discounted.\nPossibly connected to L. Ron Hubbard.\n05-03: The Hermit\nMale. European descent. Russian origin. Appears to be about 80. Has a prominent beard. Formerly affiliated with the Tsars' Seers. Signatory of the Forbidden City Convention.\nBends to consensus decision easily, even if said consensus decision is not originally his choice.\nOnly directly interacts with other O5 Council members. Uses written messages to convey orders to subordinates. Known to consistently stay in Overwatch HQ. Potential secret-keeper?")

Many recorded sightings; unlike all other members of O5 Command, commonly interacts with agents or representatives of outside anomalous groups of interest.\nHe also works with the Administrator in a more traditional ambassador role, privately meeting with heads of state and high-tier organizations such as the Global Occult Coalition/United Nations to negotiate such matters as Foundation access to countries. Has a sizable staff of diplomats working under him.\nAllegedly capable of traveling vast distances in an impossibly short time - apparently by foot. Surprisingly open about personal details, but the details of this ability are kept under wraps.\nPertinently: How does he keep finding me? And why doesn't he share that with the rest of the Foundation? Possibly bound to an esoteric/anomalous rule-set. Requires investigation.\nExcerpt from intercepted communication:\"A lot of fieldwork and being in the wrong place at the right time. Got to be a little bit of a diplomat, and ended up getting sent out to talk to various GOIs over the years. Got pretty good at it. Too good, really.\nAnother of those who ended up being promoted because he's so damned good at his job, but not entirely trusted, because he walks places people shouldn't go, and keeps secrets.\nHis loyalty isn't in doubt. Just the wisdom of his excursions.\"\n\"The Swallowed Tail\" source also depicts the Ambassador as the public face of the Foundation, but differs on all other details. Described as a Persian male, Iranian/Armenian ancestry, early-thirties, originally a French stage actor known as Jean Lemieux Betrand, born Jean Ebrahimi.\nAllegedly \"anomalously charismatic\", but there's no evidence that he's anything more than a pretty face. Defers to O5-7 \"Green\". Loyalty to the Foundation is questionable - possible weak link?\n05-04: The Martyr[DECEASED]\nMale. European descent. American origin. Early 40s. No unusual appearance.\nGained his position when forced to execute a prior O5-4 during an attempted hostile takeover of the Foundation. Held the position reluctantly. Later died under highly classified circumstances. Publicly, at least, said to have died a hero's death. I suspect otherwise, but the reports claim he was genuinely grieved, so perhaps true.\n05-04: The Frost [DECEASED]\nMale. European descent. American origin. Early 40s. No unusual appearance.\nA relaxed, gentle man, despite his stern reputation. Not shy about appearing in public, or publicizing his projects. Kept up impressive security measures to counter this. Known for traveling with a large, friendly mastiff named (almost comically) \"Rover\".\nDid not reflect the mindset of his compatriots regarding use of anomalous objects. Strongly opposed the weaponization of SCP objects. One of several O5 Council members who strongly opposed cross-testing and in many cases general research on the anomalous as well.\nCame into his own after the series of incidents that included SCP-076 causing the destruction of Area-25 and MTF Omega-7, Dr. Kondraki mostly destroying Site-19 by deliberation of breaching 682 in reaction to manipulation by O5 members, a researcher wiping himself and several sites from existence, and a string of serious accidents resulting from cross-testing SCP objects.\nFollowing these incidents, O5-4 and his newfound allies within O5 Command found their position suddenly quite popular indeed. A great number of projects were outright ended, and a new policy came into effect: little research on anomalous objects should be done except that which is necessary for containment. Research was considered too dangerous. SCP objects would be examined mostly in isolation from each other. Cross-testing mostly ceased. This would be unofficial Foundation policy for the better part of the following decade.\nO5-4's sway began to fail in more recent times, and then he was abruptly assassinated by operatives of the Chaos Insurgency. (In practice, this could mean almost anything, given the nature of the Insurgency.)\n05-04: The Collecter[OUSTED]\nMale. Descent unknown. Origin unknown. Age unknown. Appearance unknown.\nO5-4 was the first to personally succeed in bringing a complete series of Little Misters into Foundation containment, and became Mr. Collector, allegedly with assistance from the discontinued Mr. Red. Now contained as an anomalous individual, and so removed from the O5 Council.\n05-04: The Gangster[DEFECTED]\nMale. European descent. American origin. Appearance unknown.\nO5-4 played a large role in Foundation manipulation of world governments and economic systems. Additionally, he had extensive ties to organized crime and domestic terrorism, ties which existed before his elevation to the O5 Council. He simply never let them go, and the obvious utility of crime connections during the Foundation's early years allowed him to justify these questionable continuing relationships. Most people who the Foundation \"disappeared\" or assassinated during their formative years were targeted under the auspices of O5-4.\nHelped design the first iteration of the Chaos Insurgency (as a Foundation black ops project) before defecting with the fully realized Chaos Insurgency during the Foundation Civil War. Although not a mastermind of the \"true\" Insurgency (better thought of as an alliance between then-O5-7 and then-O5-11), is likely significantly responsible for its success post-schism, for when he left, he took his connections with him.\nWhen O5-4 defected, the Foundation wiped out all his operations and reassigned or terminated his remaining staff. Though this was likely a good choice for them long-term, this partially contributed to certain destabilizations in world economies of the time.\nRumored to have known Al Capone and a number of other crime lords personally.\n05-04: The Veteran\nMale. European descent. German origin. Appears to be about 50. Has a prominent mustache. Formerly affiliated with the Imperial German Anomalous Matters Examination Agency. Signatory of the Forbidden City Convention.\nBelieved to have fought in the Fifth Occult War on behalf of the German Empire, and defeated the Militia United in Righteousness (a.k.a. the Boxers). Professes unusually detailed knowledge of Daevite and Mekhanist military tactics.\nClaims to have met Napoleon Bonaparte in person, although he claims that the iteration of Bonaparte whom he met is anomalously enhanced.\nLikes to join agents and Mobile Task Force members during field operations. Restless and does not like desktop jobs.")

Favors tweed suits, usually worn with coat and a hat with a blackbird pin. Wears ties with birds. Blackbirds seem to be some sort of personal motif - unknown significance, if any.\nOverly friendly and familiar in demeanor. Tends to be laid-back and jovial given the option. One of the more prominent O5s, relatively often seen in public. Little is known about his specific role, though he has been on the Council a long time.\nAn artist of some talent; known to sketch five blackbirds as a signature.\n\"The Swallowed Tail\" source describes \"Blackbird\" as the head of the Department of Paranormal Organisation Review, which records and monitors the Foundation's \"Groups of Interest\". Also takes an interest in anomalies interacting with alternate realities. Subordinates report overhearing him talking to himself, and acting like different people at different times.\nThis individual seems to always occupy a prominent position within an organisation focused on the anomalous, even in realities in which he isn't a member of the Foundation. He can be bargained with, but do not underestimate him. He may well be the most dangerous member of the O5 Council.\n05-05: The Ordinary Man\nMale. European descent. American origin. Appears to be mid-40s. Appearance is thoroughly ordinary; prefers to appear average in almost every way. Exception: Almost always seen wearing tanned leather shoes.\nVery little knowledge is available about O5-5. Has been known to occasionally travel with SCP-108 for unknown reasons. Given experimentation records on 108, I suspect he may intend to use her (either directly or via research) as some form of last-ditch escape route.\n05-05: The Entrepreneur/The Treasurer\nMale. European/Middle Eastern descent. Western European origin. Mid-40s. No unusual appearance.\nO5-5 oversees the Foundation's front organizations. He creates funding for almost all Foundation projects. Habitually manipulates economies to the Foundation's benefit. He doesn't accomplish this directly by anomalous means; yes, the Foundation could just make gold, but then injecting large amounts of gold into an economy would tend to destabilize it. O5-5 doesn't just run the front organizations, he makes them profitable. Others hire the workers, O5-5 pays them.\nNever seen in public. Many reports identify him as the same person as O5-5 \"Blackbird\", and others call \"Blackbird\" a fiction or a false double.\n05-05: Manifest Destiny\nMale. European descent. American origin. Appears to be about 50. Clean-shaven. Formerly affiliated with the American Secure Containment Initiative. Signatory of the Forbidden City Convention.\nA firm believer in human mastery over Nature. Involved in the decimation of SCP-2750.\nMakes frequent trips to Yellowstone Park. Purpose unknown.\n05-05: The Black Cat\nApparently, O5-5 is a black housecat. This version of O5-5 is generally disguised as some sort of companion animal for a decoy O5-5, but behind closed doors the Black Cat is in charge.\nI'd dismiss this as an obvious falsehood, but I have a friend with a similar appearance, and it hasn't stopped her from becoming a major figure in the Serpent's Hand. I'd say this couldn't happen in the Foundation, but if they kept Kain \"Pathos\" Crow around despite him being transformed into a dog, I suppose anything is possible…")

Unknown significance, if any.\nFormer top Foundation field agent; other details of prior identity unknown (probable wipe) but he may be a member of the Bright Family. Professional yet genial. Reputation for high competency. Plays something of a \"jack of all trades\" role within the Foundation, but focuses particularly on issues of Foundation security.\nOne of the O5s seen more often in public. Travels with two male bodyguards referred to as \"Thompson\" and \"Black\".\n\"The Swallowed Tail\" source indicates that \"The American\" was once known as Rufus King, a Union Brigadier General and Minister to the Papal States before joining the Foundation. Now serves as \"Special Council to the Joint Chiefs of Staff\", liaison between the Foundation and the Pentagon. Has authority just below (or just above?) that of the US President. Commands the Foundation's Department of Applied Influence (Private Army), alleged to have founded Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 \"Red Right Hand\". May have been involved in the creation of Mobile Task Force Omega-7 \"Pandora's Box\" at the behest of General Bowe, despite initial opposition to this project.\nPrioritises American interests. Arrogant, often overconfident. Skilled with a whip.\nAppears to be in his mid-fifties, but for his military record to be true he'd have to be the oldest Council Member, with some way of extending his lifespan even before joining the Foundation. This is either a blatant fabrication by someone who couldn't even get the dates right, or worth looking into further.\n05-06: The Figurehead/The Elder\nMale. African descent. American origin. Verified post-human lifespan; likely 200+ years of age.\nOne of the founding members of the O5 Council, O5-6 was already old when he joined. He is now said to have aged beyond even the abilities of SCP-006 to rejuvenate him. He still survives, for now, but he rarely if ever takes any action on the O5 Council. His secretary runs things for him, up to and including voting according to his wishes on O5 Council matters.\n05-06: The Puppet\nMale. European descent. American origin. Early 40s. Typically dresses in tasteful suits.\nRarely seen in public, but a very active member of O5 Command internally. What few are aware of is that he is a puppet inserted into the O5 Council by the Global Occult Coalition as a possible future attempt at a hostile takeover, or perhaps a failsafe.\nIt seems possible that some or all of the other O5 Council members are aware of his status as a turncoat, and tolerate the situation for their own reasons. Perhaps they view him as a potential asset or at least view the knowledge of his situation as a potential asset.\n05-06: The Experimenter\nMale. European descent. Austrian origin. Appears to be about 65. Formerly affiliated with the Imperial Commission on Transgressive Occurrences.

Nearly always dresses in various shades of green clothing. Unknown significance, if any.\nOne of the longer-term members of the O5 Council. Described as not especially morally scrupulous with her power, although with her heart in the right place, or at least near the right place. A master tactician, charismatic and dangerous.\nDoes not often appear in public, and often works through intermediaries at first; a believer in private meetings over public speeches. Generally friendly in demeanor in personal interactions, right up until she's not.\nPossibly an ex-university professor (surprisingly). Has implemented a number of training programs in various areas across the Foundation.\nAlso notable for \"adopting\" Dr. Alto Clef and approving a number of his experimental (and sometimes unnecessarily dangerous) projects.\nTakes an active interest in Foundation personnel; often plays a role in recruiting O5 Council general staff. Also plays an active role in the development of experimental and even anomalous weaponry.\n\"The Swallowed Tail\" source identifies a somewhat similar O5-7. \"Green\" or \"Flytrap\" is described as a Caucasian female of British/German ancestry, appearing to be in her early fifties. Nickname comes from her green pantsuits.\nBelieved to have had a long career within the Foundation before being voted onto the council, possibly as the first replacement of an original council member. Ruthlessly pursues her (unknown) goals, de facto leader of the O5 Council as long as O5-1 does not exercise veto power. Her appearances are a source of dread for those outside of the Foundation, who describes her as \"The Devil\" or \"The Spider\". Despite her reputation, she does not appear to possess any anomalous abilities.\n05-07: The Unlikely\nMale. European descent. American origin. Appears to be mid-40s; likely older. No unusual appearance.\nReputation for being somewhat dangerous to be around. Has survived a curious number of assassination attempts unscathed (with the assassins dead in the wake of the attempts); unusual that an O5 would both leave themselves vulnerable to so many attempts and also survive so many in such a manner. Possible anomalous protection.\nTakes a special interest in SCP objects stolen or acquired by the Chaos Insurgency. Numerous reports indicate that O5-7 is, in fact, the current head of the Chaos Insurgency, despite this directly contradicting many other reports about the Chaos Insurgency's status as a splinter organization. Reports differ on whether the rest of the O5 Council is unaware of this, or knows and partially or fully endorses it.\n05-07: The Professor/The Heretic[DEFECTED]\nMale. European descent. American origin. Appearance unknown.\nA professor at a major university and a trained psychologist; held the former position even while a member of the O5 Council, before disappearing from both upon defection. Developed a large number of training programs across the Foundation, many of which are still in use today in some form.\nOne of the primary instigators of the Foundation Civil War. Defected from the Foundation along with the then-current O5-4, O5-11, and O5-12, as well as a number of Foundation generals and another O5 who was killed during the schism.\nA major thought leader in the Insurgency; possibly co-created the first iteration of the Insurgency, which seems to have been originally an organization used for covert Foundation operations under another (relatively nonsensical) name, and likely still exists in this form as well as the latter-day article. Embraced the name \"Chaos Insurgency\" as legitimate during the schism; is likely the reason the Chaos Insurgency is called the Chaos Insurgency. Apparently still active in the Insurgency to this day.\nAdvocated for research into numerous venues the rest of the O5 Council deemed too dangerous to touch, including chaos magics and a reality-warping god-engine (both in current use by the Chaos Insurgency today). Advocated for large-scale weaponization and active use of SCP objects. Spent an inordinate amount of time researching the brain structure of anomalous humanoids.\nForesaw the increase in anomalies that was only beginning to be experienced by the Foundation (and general anomalous community) of the time; expressed that to survive, the Foundation would need move from merely preserving normalcy to actively determining normalcy, and determining the future for the human race at large.\nAccused of having a 'god complex'; took these accusations as a compliment. Took the position that God was missing or dead, and therefore the Foundation needed to take his place. A line often quoted by his supporters: \"Heaven is empty, and all the angels are here.\"\n05-07: Teeth\nAgender. East Asian descent. Chinese origin. Verified post-human lifespan. Appears to be mid-40s; almost certainly older. Androgynous appearance (in normal form). Always wears two ivory hair-sticks. Reports claim these were fashioned from human teeth/bone; obvious occult significance.\nUnusually for an O5 Council member, it seems unclear whether O5-7 was originally fully human. They possess the ability to shift between a human form and a variety of difficult-to-describe eldritch beings. They are supposedly involved in the containment of (and maybe collaboration with) certain \"extraplanar\" entities beyond Lovecraft's weirdest dreams.\nThis is an unusual set of reports. This O5-7 is supposedly both very human (hard to get more specifically human than all those culturally specific details), and yet supernatural to an extreme degree. The consistency in the reports has disturbing implications about the Foundation's hidden activities, even if this O5-7 is a cover for someone or something else.\n")
