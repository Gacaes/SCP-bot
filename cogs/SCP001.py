Object Class: Keter
Special Containment Procedures: To date, no adequate containment procedure has been developed to deal with the possible threat posed by SCP-001. This is due, in part, to the controversial nature of the item and debates concerning the necessity of its containment. This controversy is reflected in the item’s changing object class and the procedures utilized in its containment. The current administration, despite charges of paranoia, has classed the object Keter, while requesting permission for a higher object class to be created and applied uniquely to this item, considering it to be the most dangerous of all known or possible items. The reason for this classification and changing attitudes towards SCP-001 are dealt with in the description and notes.
At present, SCP-001 is located in a code-locked briefcase made of a high-tensile reinforced polymer. The room and the briefcase are monitored at all times by security cameras. The briefcase cannot be opened without unanimous special clearance from all current O5 officers. The briefcase itself is stored in a small, fully lit, single-room off-site building erected in ███ ██████ ██████. Class D personnel are posted to guard the building but may not enter without the aforementioned agreement from the O5 officers, under threat of immediate termination. This off-site building exists for the sole purpose of housing SCP-001 and is wired for detonation in an emergency.
It is the opinion of the current administration that SCP-001 represents the greatest threat to national and global security known to exist. Nevertheless, due to special circumstances regarding its mode of function, further research on the item is disallowed, despite its promotion in the past, when SCP-001 was contained in minimum security conditions.
Description: SCP-001 is a simple sheaf of papers, stapled together in the top left corner.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The top sheet is a covering sheet reading simply, “Confidential Report on Special Items—Classified.” The number of subsequent papers stapled to this covering sheet is indeterminate, and have ranged from three to thirty. The report is unsigned and its origin is unknown.
The first appearance of this report was on ███████ █, ████, when it appeared on the desk of ████████ █████ (deceased). The report at that time described “The ‘Living’ Room” (SCP-002). Shortly after reading the report with incredulity, ████████ █████ was contacted by phone regarding said item. The next time ████████ █████ perused SCP-001, it described not “The ‘Living’ Room” but “Biological Motherboard” (SCP-003). ████████ █████ immediately closed SCP-001, thinking it was a different report, and searched for the original report on SCP-002. Not finding it, he again opened SCP-001, and this time it described not SCP-003 but “The 12 Rusty Keys and the Door” (SCP-004). ████████ █████ closed the report once more and opened it immediately, to read of “Skeleton Key” (SCP-005). It is not known what the next actions of ████████ █████ might have been. At varying times following this incident, the aforementioned items were discovered.
Insufficient research exists concerning the correlation between SCP-001 and all other known items. However, it has been established that every event regarding the discovery of a new SCP item has followed a report on that same item appearing beneath the cover sheet of SCP-001. The current administration regards this coincidence as proof of causal connection.
Additional Notes: Whether SCP-001 is to be regarded as an advance-warning system or whether SCP-001 itself is to be regarded as the creator of the items requiring special containment remains to be seen. However, the distinction is unimportant in the eyes of the current administration. The fact remains: no new SCP items appear unless SCP-001 is opened and read.""")

Arguments concerning the non-lethality of SCP-001 itself, its theoretically beneficial use as an SCP warning system, or its use as a progenitor of advanced biological and non-biological weapons have not swayed the current administration. Nor have arguments criticizing the extreme containment procedures employed in respect to an item that displays no nefarious qualities and is not animate as such. Critics are reminded that these procedures are intended not to contain the item itself, but to isolate it from human interaction, which is to be regarded as the true threat.
Although the current administration refuses to remove the object from isolation barring special authorization as noted above, past administrations have counseled daily with the item, and future administrations will no doubt counsel similar behavior.

Description: SCP-001 is a humanoid entity, approximately seven hundred (700) cubits in height, located in an undisclosed location near the intersection of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The following features are known about the entity:
A number of luminous, wing-like appendages emerging from the shoulders, back, temples, ankles, and wrists of the entity. Although an accurate count has never been established, most observers place the number of wings at anywhere from two (2) through one hundred and eight (108), with the mean number being four (4).
A weapon, possibly a sword or knife (SCP-001-2). The weapon appears to emit flames at a temperature rivaling that of the sun, based on spectrographic analysis, although there appear to be no destructive effects from the intense heat on the surrounding area. Any entity that approaches within 1 km of SCP-001 is immediately struck by the weapon and obliterated from existence. Any and all hostile actions taken towards SCP-001 have resulted in the annihilation of the attacker, regardless of range (see incident report re: Indian Ocean Submarine Missile Experiment, December 26, 2004)
SCP-001 appears to be standing with its head bowed in a gesture of supplication with SCP-001-2 held in both hands point-down in front of it. Since originally recorded by the Founder over [DATA REDACTED] years ago, SCP-001 has not deviated from this stance.

This is the organization now known as the SCP Foundation.
Observers have reported that SCP-001 appears to be standing in front of a gate of immense proportions. Long-range photographs have occasionally detected what appears to be a pastoral grove within, containing numerous other entities of the same composition as SCP-001, as well as several fruit trees of unknown composition. Of particular note are two fruit trees of immense proportion near what appears to be the center of the grove: one, it is noted, appears to be an ordinary apple tree, although the other bears a fruit unknown on earth, described as [DATA EXPUNGED].
It is the avowed belief of the Founder that the gate which SCP-001 guards may be the gate to [EXPUNGED] based on correlations with ancient Babylonian texts and the Dead Sea Scrolls. In which case, one can deduce that the entity known as SCP-001 may be [EXPUNGED]

Object Class: Safe
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is to be kept locked along with all data pertaining to it inside the Primary Archival Vault on Sub-Level 1 of Site 10. The Vault is a custom-manufactured, reinforced concrete and steel, vertical octagonal prism (see Appendix U for full schematics) with a 2000-kg, 0.9-m-thick, time-locked access portal in the ceiling. The time-locking schedule should be classified and available only to Dr. Y. Mirski. Access is conditional on three-factor authorization (e.g. keycard+fingerprint+passphrase). SCP-001 is among the safest artifacts in the Foundation's possession and these measures are primarily intended to prevent theft.
Description: SCP-001 is a smooth, black, perfectly ellipsoidal (~15.1 cm x 15.4 cm x 16.5 cm) onyx gemstone with a mottled white pattern. Wrapped around its exterior, encompassing its equator and both poles, is a complex and layered fractal filigree of gold metal. The gold is sculpted into broad strokes at what is now usually agreed to be the lower or "south" pole of the object, but with increasing "latitude" the pattern becomes progressively more intricate. Near the "north" pole, also called the "lock" or "singularity" (see acquisition report, below), the pattern complexity progresses beyond the capability of optical or electron-beam microscopes to resolve. Further investigation is pending advances in microscopy technology.
The gemstone continuously emits a small quantity (~34.5007 to 34.5010 mW) of thermal radiation in the microwave range. As a result, the gold filigree is warm to the touch. The white mottled areas emit fractionally more radiation than the black onyx areas.
Other than this, SCP-001 is totally inert. It is opaque to all forms of electromagnetic and hard radiation, and, so far, indestructible (see log for Project Pluto, below).""")

SCP-001 Acquisition Report
The earliest record of SCP-001 is in the handwritten journal of the minor Scottish aristocrat Sir Edwin Young, 3rd Baronet (1611-1677). As was customary at the time, Young kept a "Cabinet of Curiosities", a small room of artifacts of undetermined provenance such as sculptures, preserved creatures, and trinkets. Young's journal includes references to his acquisition in 1654 of "ane bouned jew'l of onycs and filigree gold, of fineneſs beyond rational ſtatement" while travelling across the Mesopotamian desert. The journal indicates that SCP-001 was found buried in the ruin of "a bitter, blaſted place, older than days", or what Young took to be a temple to "a fearſome death god". SCP-001 was found encased in stone at the centre of four enormous runic stones.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Young's journal includes a sketch of the most readable side of the most well-preserved stone, but he was unable to read the runes or find a scholar who could translate them.
Young's account of his journey to the location of the ruin is incomplete. It has not yet been located.
Young's "ſelections of curious provenance" lay in storage for several centuries after he died. In 1805, his descendants donated SCP-001 to the Scottish National Museum in Edinburgh. The curators of the museum regarded SCP-001 as an ancient, fragile, and priceless example of ancient Sumerian metalworking. They therefore failed to discover its anomalous warmth, its indestructibility, or its impossible microscopic-scale construction. They were, however, able to identify the runes in Young's sketch as Tertiary Sumerian Cuneiform, circa 3400 BCE. Only a partial translation is possible:
with loss and ????? we/I ?????? [a noun] Apakht [probably a proper noun] on this ending/finality ?????????? joy + permanence [possibly 'protection']
Mr. McCandlish, who performed the translation, noted:
This appears to be some sort of incantation or "spell of containment". "Apakht" is the name of whatever is imprisoned within the gemstone.
SCP-001 was finally placed on semi-permanent display in 1949.
In 2003, Foundation staff observed that the mottled white patterns on the surface of SCP-001 resembled the cosmic microwave background, a pattern of microwaves encompassing the entire observable universe, as mapped by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe earlier that year. Closer inspection showed the two patterns to be identical. SCP-001 (along with Baronet Young's journal) was immediately purchased by a Foundation front organization and transferred to Site 10 where Dr. Q. Hack and Dr. Y. Mirski performed initial routine analysis.

SCP-001 is an O5's tale
Good evening, Doctor.
No, no, don't stand up. And, yes, I am who you think I am. Let's not make any more of this than it is. You know my number, and I know enough about you to make a duplicate that even your mother wouldn't be able to tell apart from the real you. No, that's not a threat, just a fact.
Now, as to my business here, it seems you have stumbled upon something above your clearance. Well, no, stumbled is not the right word. Dug up? Perhaps. And you are getting to the point where further digging would end in some fairly lethal gunshot wounds. This would be a sad state of affairs, as you are otherwise quite a good researcher. Therefore, you are getting something very few people in the Foundation ever get… an explanation.
Yes, we were alerted when you first started digging into SCP-001. Every researcher who's been around for a while looks into it. Most are satisfied when they uncover the angel with the flaming sword, it's buried under enough levels. But then you started looking into The Factory, and that is when I knew you wouldn't stop. So, here it is, plain and simple.
The Factory is SCP-001.
But it will never be written up. It was a choice I made early on in the creation of the Foundation, and a choice I still stand by. You researchers are far too curious. I'm not sure which scares me worse. That we'll never understand the Factory… or that we one day will. Ah well, I'm sure you're eager to learn more.
The Factory was built in 1835. Back then it was known as The Anderson Factory, named after James Anderson, a rather well-to-do industrialist. It was built in, well, we'll just say America, and was the largest factory yet designed, a good mile across at its widest, three stories tall throughout, with a special seven story tower by the front gate that Anderson lived in. It was designed to be the ultimate factory, capable of taking care of everything, including the housing of workers.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" People could be born, work, live, and die, without ever leaving the confines of the Factory. And work they did, on everything from cattle raising and slaughtering, to textiles, to everything else under the sun.
Now, no one knows whether James Anderson was actually a Satan worshiper. It's just as likely that he followed some kind of Pagan gods. What is known is that he was VERY exact in the building of his factory, and in the placement of his machinery within it. Survivors claim the floor was engraved with arcane symbols, that were only visible when blood flowed across them… But then the survivors claimed a lot of things. What is known is that Anderson made his money on the blood and sweat, and sometimes body parts of the lower class. His journals indicate he thought of them as less than human, being put on this Earth only to serve his will.
Of course, at that time, no one knew about his predilections, and so people flocked to the Factory. A place to both work and live at the same time? Well, of course people wanted in! Never mind the harsh hours, working conditions, sadistic security force, and all the rest. Factory workers were forced to work 16 hour days, work only shutting down on Sundays, between sunrise and sunset. Workers were not given individual rooms, instead sharing rooms with eight other people, sleeping in shifts of three. Medical attention was unheard of. If you were injured in the course of your duties, which most people were, you were expected to just keep working. Anyone too injured to work was dragged off by the security, never to be heard from again.
For forty years, the Anderson Factory cranked out all sorts of things for people. Meat, clothes, weapons. Never mind that the beef might be mixed with human. Don't care that the weapons were forged in blood. No attention need be paid that the clothes were dyed with…well, you get the idea. Rumors leaked out, but the products were so good, why bother? Until someone got out.""")

I never met the brave soul who managed to escape, but she managed to meet with President Grant, and, in 1875, he enlisted my aid. At the time I was… well, it doesn't matter.

We'd been cleaning out some Confederate holdouts, and some of the worse things we found down South. So, we did some research, didn't like what we saw, and went in, loaded for bear.
I don't actually remember much about the night it all went down. Most of it blends together in my head. I get flashes, sometimes, of the people chained to the line, living next to dead, and damned hard to tell which was which. Children working underneath machines, the majority of the flesh scoured from their bones by the great wheels and cogs. And the other things…
No, I'm all right. I haven't thought about that night for a very long time. The security force wasn't much of a problem. But then Anderson's creations showed up. He'd been taking the injured workers and, well, experimenting on them. Men, if you could call them men, with multiple arms, sewn together, some of them combined with animals, horrible monstrosities out of mankind's worst nightmares. They kept coming, wave after wave of not quite living creatures. I lost a lot of good people that night.

I'm sorry. Even today, more than a century later, the memory makes me see red. When we finally found Anderson cowering in his office, we hung him from his tower window, with his own entrails. As he died, he laughed, saying it didn't matter, we could kill him, but his factory, The Factory, would go on. He was still laughing 24 hours later when we finally cut him down, had him drawn and quartered, and then burned the remains.""")

We spent a week cleaning that place out, freeing the workers, putting down the things we found in the basements and many lightless rooms. We pulled out things that were useful, stocked them in a house near the gate, tried to make sense of everything. A hundred and fifty of us went into that hell pit that night, and only ninety-three came out. By the end of that week, we were down to seventy-one.
But the things we found in there, my god. Well, you've been with the Foundation a while, they wouldn't seem as amazing to you, but we found toy guns that shot real bullets. A yo-yo that would flay the skin from anyone it touched, hammers that only worked on human flesh. A breed of skeletal horse that ran faster than anything we'd ever seen. Cloaks that seemed woven from the night itself, and let men access a shadowy dimension that… I get away from myself. We found tools, both wondrous and horrible. And we were faced with a choice.
I gathered my highest ranking, well, we'll call them officers, to me, and we tried to figure out what we would do. They all had opinions. The Chaplain, he had gone a little crazed. Thought all these objects must be miracles sent from god, holy relics to be worshipped. Marshall and his little toady Dawkins thought there was a fortune to be made here, making and selling these things to the highest bidder. The Injun we all called Bass, due to his deep speaking voice, he called these things an abomination, and declared that we should hunt down and destroy everything we could find. And Smith thought we should take this stuff back to the president. The only one without an opinion was the old man, but he never said much of anything anyways. We argued for hours, days, trying to work it out. Me, I thought we were sitting on a gold mine, all right.""")

I'm sure you can figure out what happened. The Chaplain snuck away in the night with his devotees, taking a couple of small items with him. Marshall we kicked out when we found him… abusing his authority. He promised he'd get revenge, and that little Dawkins shit led the rest of their group off with some of the juicier items. Bass and his people tried to light the whole damn thing on fire, then just left when it didn't work. And Smith left, to report back to the president. I did manage to get him to promise me he'd tell Grant the Factory had been destroyed. I had big plans for that place.
A'course, it was kinda hard to follow through on big plans when you only have 12 other people to work with. But it was a start.
And it worked, for a while. We had these amazing toys, and finding people to work with us was easy. Back then, going off the grid was as simple as leaving town. We knew what we wanted, we knew what we could be.
Leventhal set out getting us backing. A simple invention here, some well invested money there, it all worked out. White and Jones set out getting us… other backing. In our previous work we'd found out some interesting things about people. Some secrets that powerful men didn't want getting out. And, with our new position helping keep secrets, we got more people asking us to deal with their secrets. Blackmail is a dirty word, but it works. Bright, Argent and Lumineux got to work cataloging the items. Light and Bright's wife, the nurse, they made sure we kept ourselves healthy. Heh. No, it's just, remembering Light.

We thought we had the Factory tamed. That's one of the reasons I refuse to quit this job. If there's anything I can do here, it's remind people that we will NEVER tame these things. Contain them, yes, but as we saw with Able, tame them? Never.
After a decade or so, we were pretty organized. The 13 original of us were being called by numbers, not names. We knew how to make things work. And, if a thing or two vanished inside of the Factory, still? And the occasional D-class? What? Yes, we had D-class back then. Disposables. That's where the D comes from.

Memo from the Office of The Administrator
Humanity has existed in its current state for hundreds of millennia, yet only the last few have held any meaning for us. What did we do for the countless years before recorded history? We huddled in caves, warding off the night with small fires, fearful of the things that we could not understand. It was not just that we did not understand why the sun rose every morning, it was the mystery of enormous fish with the heads of men, and rocks that came to life, and monsters that drove those who saw them mad. So we called them 'angels' and 'devils', begged them to spare us from their wrath, and prayed for salvation.
As time passed, their numbers died out and mankind flourished. The world began to make more sense. Yet, the unexplained can never truly go away, as if the universe requires for there to be things we can never truly understand.
We will not go back into the dark, fearful night. We will not be ruled by the unknown. We will stand up for ourselves.
Even as the rest of humanity remains uninformed, we will fight the darkness, containing it and shielding it from the eyes of the common man, so that they can continue to live in the blissful illusion of a normal world.

We had conquered death through advances in medicine and technology, and we thought ourselves masters of our own fates.
We realized too late that all such things have a cost, and that our greed and hubris would not only result in the loss of everything we held dear, but doom countless others as well. Our meddling in the structure of existence had opened up cracks and twists in the fabric of reality, a Corruption of the multiverse that we had failed to notice earlier because we could not see the pieces of our reality leaking into others. By the time feedback began to manifest, it was already too late to stop it.
Before this Corruption consumed us completely, we came up with one final fail-safe. We would gather up what knowledge we could save and sacrifice our world to send a single individual through to the next. This could not repair the damage that had already been done, but could buy us the time to start over, to find a way to stop the Corruption of reality. That individual was me.

Like a rain of glass, the shattered remains of other universes will begin to fall and slip into yours.

Ask yourself if you want to know.
If the answer is no, then you need to stop reading now. If you go and report this unauthorized file to your superiors, act contrite, and claim that you only read to this paragraph, you might get away with a Class A Amnestic. If you’re lucky. And if the O5s aren’t particularly paranoid at the moment.
So you want to know what SCP-001 is? The first answer is that it ~~is~~ was a placeholder, a theoretical designation for the prime cause, the ultimate reason for all the paranormal crap we deal with on a daily basis. SCP-001 is why we have to deal with omnicidal reptiles, ever expanding rooms, extra-dimensional pools of red goop and consumer products that don’t obey the normal laws of physics. Of course, given that all these things— as dangerous and deadly and just plain insane as they all are— are inherently patternless and self-contradictory, most researchers are convinced that there is no possible unifying principle for them all, much less a common source.
They’re wrong.
There’s more than one reason that cross-testing is discouraged, and the O5s even look down on excessive cross-referencing of SCPs. The O5s don’t want any one group looking at more than a handful of these things at once, because of what they discovered when the Foundation tried to develop a Grand Unified Theory of SCPs. That research is mostly gone now.""")

I was a data analyst at Site-001-Alpha [Note to O5 Command: Don’t bother looking for me, I finished the job you started, the identities of all former staff at Site-001-Alpha have been completely scrubbed from the records, you know as much as they do now.] and I participated in the first and only attempt to consolidate all Foundation data on all SCPs. I was in charge of data integrity. And as much of a mess as you might think that was, it was an order of magnitude worse.
Forget the memetic SCPs, or the ones that modify their own description, or the ones that seem to only inhabit infospace and slip into the database to wreak havoc. That’s all SOP for anyone who works with the Foundation’s network, just a matter of scale. Worse were the completely inexplicable, unexpected changes in data
Sorry, that’s wrong, even though I can’t help thinking of it that way. It isn’t a change in data when reality is shifting to match. I don’t know a lot about the internals of the software we used, but I know that part of it ran outside what we think of as the “real world.” And, at first, everyone thought that the audit trails it produced were some sort of bug. However, it became apparent that the nature of the software, its purposeful isolation from the narrative-affecting SCPs, allowed it to record something far more important.
It’s not visible to you, or the O5s, or even to most of the SCPs we deal with, but the Foundation— and by extension the entire universe— is in a state of constant shifting reality flux.

Yeah. Something a lot like SCP-140, and infinitely larger in scale.
I don’t know who did the analysis, and if I did, I wouldn’t say. She’s probably a lot happier not knowing about her own discovery. But she looked at what vanished and what appeared, and what subtly changed in the records, and she found the pattern, the drift toward darkness, toward narrative coherence, toward a plot...

Research at Site-001-Gamma has conducted narrative analysis on SCP-001's changes to the observable universe. Conclusions are that SCP-001 consists of multiple entities showing cognitive patterns that are indistinguishable from human, and that these entities are therefore susceptible to memetic effects. Since prior experiments have shown information feedback via the SCP data warehouse, a possible method of attack and or control has been developed.""")

Memetic agents inserted to promote calm and/or well-being
Memetic agents inserted to promote sleep, unconsciousness or catatonia.
Memetic agents inserted to cause death.

UIU File 0041: Altered High School Building in ██████, ██ (Confirmed Anomaly 3)
Object Class: 53 (Highly intrusive, unknown capabilities, unknown nature)
Secure Containment Protocols: Confirmed Anomaly 3 (CA3) is to be surrounded by an electric fence no less than 30 feet high and guarded by the United States Army’s █████ Platoon. Any footage or photographic evidence of CA3’s interior is to be excised as soon as possible, and all witnesses detained indefinitely.
Under no circumstances should any personnel attempt to enter CA3 or communicate with the persons inhabiting it. However, any person known to have been inside CA3 at any point must be detained and interrogated.
A direct military assault on CA3 has been deemed unfeasible at this point, due to the unknown capabilities of the entity or entities by which it is controlled.
Note: This is a summary, and it does not contain all information relevant to CA3. For detailed information regarding CA3, see UIU Files 0042 through 0218- Director ██████
Known Information: The Unusual Incidents Unit was alerted to CA3’s existence on September 7, 1954, when students attending ██████████ High School reported that the interior of the building was vastly different than it had been at any point in the past.
Upon discovery, CA3 exhibited several unusual, if not inherently paranormal, traits:
Nearly all walls in the facility had been replaced with steel-reinforced concrete, although several rooms were constructed of other materials for no readily apparent reason. All exterior windows had been covered from the inside.
All student desks, personal effects, textbooks, and other materials expected of a public high school were completely absent. Lockers were still present, albeit significantly smaller and constructed of stainless steel.
The arrangement, location, and size of rooms and facilities did not match blueprints for the school.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Often, rooms would exhibit seemingly random modifications, although the number of changed rooms is currently unknown.
No fewer than seventeen electronic computers were found, each of which made use of state-of-the-art magnetic-core RAM. Prior to its classification as a confirmed anomaly, ██████████ High School had no computers. All files on the computers were inaccessible, and the computers themselves are firmly bolted down.
The auditorium is inaccessible due to a large steel wall completely blocking the doorways. Attempts to move or damage this barrier have been ineffective. The extent and purpose of the barrier are unknown, as are the contents of the auditorium.
A team sent into CA3’s interior to do a complete survey (Team CA3-O5) did not return, nor did a second team (Team CA3-O6) tasked with locating the first team. The facilities are currently under lockdown pending new containment protocols.
Update: Twenty-three days after initial recovery, guards reported "white noise" emanating from CA3, the volume of which increased near its auditorium. Five hours later, the white noise stopped, although the sound of voices was audible from the interior of CA3.
Upon further investigation, it was found that the building now contained a large number of persons, all of whom appeared to be wandering aimlessly through the facility. Notably, each individual was physically identical to a member of Team CA3-O6, despite the inhabitants of CA3 vastly outnumbering the members of Team CA3-O6. Attempts to interview or detain the inhabitants were thwarted by [CLASSIFIED]. The twelve members of Team CA3-O5 were not found. In addition to the aforementioned, the interior layout of CA3 had changed significantly since the previous investigations. No mechanism which could explain this has been identified.
Update: Three months after the previous incident, white noise was again heard emanating from the auditorium. This time, the decision was made to investigate immediately.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" It was found that most of CA3-2 (the designation given to the inhabitants of CA3) had gathered near the doors of the auditorium. A circular hole roughly six feet in diameter had formed in the steel barrier, although the interior was not visible. At 0310 hours, an item resembling a [CLASSIFIED] emerged from the hole and was carried away by an inhabitant. The item was placed in one of the classrooms (which had not previously been observed to open). This process continued for upwards of eight hours, with a new item being produced once every three minutes. Most were seen entering a different room or locker, although insufficient personnel were available to track all items.
Further investigation revealed that most, if not all of the items produced exhibited anomalous properties themselves. A significant portion of CA3-2 are involved in either guarding the items produced (collectively, CA3-3) or performing various tests on them.
Update: Two days after the previous incident, three identical armed "guards" appeared near each entrance to CA3. Further attempts to enter the building were futile, as these guards have consistently overpowered all teams sent to enter CA3, regardless of injury or relative level of armament.
Note: Reports gathered during the two days prior to guards manifesting outside of CA3 appear to confirm that CA3-2 is following standard UIU protocol regarding the items produced by the auditorium. Their knowledge of UIU standard procedure is consistent with that of Team CA3-O5.
Update: During the UIU’s tracking of CA6, two men identical to Agent Dixon (a member of CA3-O6) emerged from a parked car and forcibly detained CA6, dragging him into the car and driving away. Tracking the vehicle for the next eight hours revealed that it was driving directly to CA3. Upon arrival, the vehicle drove directly through the front doors, which the "guards" had opened shortly before their arrival. CA6 has not been recovered.""")

Special Containment Procedures: Instances of SCP-001 are to be contained within standard humanoid containment modules. Under no circumstances are any instances of SCP-001 to be stored at the same site, allowed to interact in any manner, or to be made aware of information regarding other members of the group. Personnel assigned to any single SCP-001 subject are not to be made aware of the other instances of SCP-001 or the connections among them.
SCP-001 subjects are not to come into direct contact with any other anomalous items outside of approved testing.
REVISED ██/██/20██: O5 SPECIAL ORDER A-1130-X
In light of the events resultant in SCP-001-05's death, the use of SCP-001 subjects in the neutralization of anomalous objects is hereby prohibited. All care is to be taken to keep SCP-001 subjects alive and unharmed. Recovery and containment of SCP-001 subjects is to be considered highest priority. In the case of a death event, Ouroboros Protocol is to be initiated as soon as possible.
Description: SCP-001 is a group of thirty-six individuals, designated SCP-001-01 through SCP-001-036. There is no apparent pattern in terms of ethnicity, gender, age, or religious affiliation amongst SCP-001 subjects.
SCP-001 subjects display no anomalous properties of their own. However, any anomalous item, entity, or property brought into close proximity with an SCP-001 subject will be greatly modified from its original properties: most often, this will result in a lessening or total nullification of anomalous properties. Those properties not nullified will be changed so as to display consistency between objects of similar properties. All of these effects are instantaneous and will occur without any input from the subject.""")

All subjects of SCP-001 seem to be instinctively aware of information regarding other SCP-001 subjects, generally the total number of the group and details of between one and three individuals. This knowledge is vague, making locating uncontained subjects difficult.
The death of an SCP-001 subject will result in the manifestation of multiple anomalous entities and phenomena in the area. These manifestations will be of such a scope that traditional containment measures are unfeasible, and will result in significant casualties and collateral damage. Contained SCP-001 subjects have claimed that this is a result of the deceased individual's absence "letting things through", and that further events will be more severe as time progresses. In addition, contained subjects have claimed that any deceased individuals will be replaced by a newborn bearing the appropriate properties: no such individuals have yet been located.

Dr. ████████: Can you describe the dream?
SCP-001-05: There was a man, a man in rich clothing, like a king or emperor. He kept saying “Where is the tailor? Where is my tailor?” and pacing back and forth. Each time he asked it, another voice would answer “He is close now, he is close at hand”. But he did not arrive. The man became more and more upset, and as he paced moths came and landed on him, and began to eat away at his clothing. His robes began to fray and rot as more and more moths landed on him, and some even bit his skin. But then, the doors opened and there arrived not one tailor, but dozens, led by the most masterful tailor in the kingdom. The king was overjoyed, for he knew he would be saved from the moths that tried to consume him. I woke up then, and I knew. He found me, and I followed him.

Test Log Scp-001/1348
Foreword: Following the death of SCP-001-05, Site 87's Archaeological Containment Unit underwent a class-DK event (Dimensional Shift), vanishing and therefore becoming inaccessible to outside access or communication. Following the death of SCP-001-012, Site 87 returned to its previous position. Upon its return, an exploration team was sent to investigate SCP-1348's containment status, and discovered the following alterations to its workings:
All Foundation personnel present on-site at the time of its disappearance were absent, as was their personal gear, technical equipment and food rations.
Five (5) new instances of SCP-1348-1 appeared in SCP-1348's inner chamber. Unlike the previously discovered SCP-1348-1-E, these new instances appeared to be in perfect health. Said instances were found performing SCP-1348-2.
The ritual designated SCP-1348-2 has been altered, likely due to the presence of the aforementioned instances of SCP-1348-1. Performance of the altered SCP-1348-2 by instances of SCP-1348-1 lacks the memetic effect of its previous incarnation. Since SCP-1348-3's veil was now permanently opened, the purpose of the altered SCP-1348-2 is currently unclear.
The inner chamber designated SCP-1348-3 was significantly altered. The decorations in the chamber, formerly all of proto-Semitic style, now included designs from a much wider selection of cultures, including Mesoamerican, proto-Indo-European, and Antarctican, in addition to designs clearly originating from a much later period than SCP-1348's supposed construction date.""")

SECURITY MEMETIC: ON BASALT FEET WE STOOD......Answer sufficient
The following communique originated within the leadership of GOI-16 "The Horizon Initiative". The message was found alongside item E-7455 during recovery on ██/██/20██.
How do you explain to someone that the world is dying, and that only they may save it?
We have often asked ourselves that question, during the sixty or so years since that faithful day in Jerusalem, and entertained different notions on the most effective ways to do so. Fifty years ago, we were Elijah, full of bluster and wrath, calling upon our less faithful brothers to rally to the Thirty-Six’s cause, using fear to further our goals. Thirty years ago, we were Isaiah, seeking to strengthen our less courageous brothers that with the conviction that our cause was just, speaking of the greatness of our task, using their new found confidence to build an order on which our goals could stand. Ten years ago, we were Jeremiah, weeping at the doors of the world’s great powers, pleading for them to listen, for we now understood that this task was beyond our power alone.
And now? Now we are Jonah, and are lost for words. How do we make you understand what is at stake, when the only way you could see is to let everything your organization ever did go for the word of three old men? That is too much to ask even of righteous men, and we are not yet certain you are such. All we can ask is that you listen.
You have seen what the Thirty-Six can do. You have seen the way the world unravels around them, but you do not understand why.""")

The items and phenomena you keep hidden from the world are not diseases, they are symptoms, and you are not keeping the world healthy by masking them when the underlying condition is ignored. The problem is that this condition is chronic. The world is simply old, and the Thirty-Six… they might make it young again.
For them to be able to do so, you will be required to make the ultimate sacrifice- you must relinquish your identity. You were made to secure, and we are asking you to trust in the unproven. You were made to contain, and we are asking you to release. You were meant to protect, and we are asking you to leave the world vulnerable. It is an impossible request, this we know. But you must fulfill it if there is to be any hope for us. Release the Thirty-Six, let them come together. Let them do what needs to be done, and we shall follow.
Help three old men make the world young again. Don't let it die.""")

Adjustment of containment procedures became necessary, and the internal structure of the containment site, now designated Site-001, was reinforced. Personnel chambers were moved back to an off-site location roughly 5km from the central testing facility.\nAn attack on a Foundation research facility in the Sudan by Kingdom of Abaddon forces increased the drastic need for a long-range defense system, and expedited the timeline for an active Item-001. By order of the Foundation Administrator, additional resources were granted to aid in the development of more effective testing protocols.\nAnother primary concern became the containment of the anomaly within a single human subject. In 100% of all test subjects, while the anomalous nature would transfer with little incident, subjects would become immediately paralyzed and suffer from severe cerebral hemorrhaging. The only evidence of the anomaly taking effect was the sudden and random destruction of on-site structures and personnel, theorized to be the result of a loss of control due to deteriorated mental capacities in the subjects. In 100% of all cases, mind-kill agents were utilized to terminate the Pre-Item-001 entity.\nAdditional research conducted by off-site personnel gave light to the possibility of spreading the anomaly over a number of subjects3, thus managing the increased mental load of the anomalous properties4.""")

These humanoids appear similar to human beings in a number of ways, but all instances appear to be at least Class I Reality Bending entities5, with higher ranking individuals reaching Class III and IV classifications. Due to their anomalous qualities, capture and containment of these instances is impossible, and attempting to do so is often exceedingly dangerous.\nInitial Discovery: GOI-003 was initially observed by French military personnel in 1912, during an investigation of attacks against a small village in northern Libya. The military convoy was ambushed, resulting in the deaths of 80% of the contingent. Survivors reported an attack by no more than 6 \"sorcerers\", who were capable of flight and resistant to arms fire.""")

MTF ά-4 was successful in repelling these forces, and managed to capture a lower ranking individual. After processing and interrogation, the true nature of the \"Kingdom of Abaddon\" was realized, and Foundation Central Command began taking steps to protect the Foundation from the anomalous group.\nAccording to gathered data, the \"Kingdom of Abaddon\" was originally a group of reality bending entities from Arabia who sought to carve out a nation of their own within the inhospitable Sahara. Because of their nature, they were able to adapt the harsh landscape to their needs, and used the terrain to keep intruders away. Over time, their numbers grew, and new births were brought before the ruler of the kingdom, \"God King Abaddon\", to be changed into additional reality bending entities.\nHowever, due to inbreeding and other genetic malfunctions that plague their society, GOI-003 is particularly fragile and will likely not last on its own as an independent organization for any longer than 20 years. Collected data implies that Abaddon is aware of this, and is taking steps to assure its future. To this end, a number of Foundation facilities in and around the African continent have come under attack by Kingdom of Abaddon aggressors, who have cost the Foundation no fewer than seventy-five lives thus far, and who have stolen at least 12 different items.""")

Object Class: Maksur1

Special Containment Procedures: Information on the relevancy of SCP-001 to the related anomalous objects are to be omitted from the respective objects' documentation. While connections with the Church of the Broken God can remain available, the origins of the items are to be omitted or obfuscated.

The inactive component of SCP-001 is to remain in its current location, and any shipping or diving is forbidden in that area. Civilian discovery of SCP-001 is to be suppressed, and amnestics are to be utilized in order to maintain classification.

Description: SCP-001 is a collection of anomalous items, formerly a single, massive mechanical entity assembled by members of the Church of the Broken God in late 1942 near La Paz, Mexico. Items include SCP-217, SCP-1139, SCP-882, and several internal components of SCP-629.3 A full list is available here.

Members of the Church combined the various anomalous objects in an effort to restore their deity. Upon activation, SCP-001 reportedly began to integrate metallic objects into itself while actively seeking other anomalous objects. SCP-001, and the resulting "001-Apotheosis" event that took place as a result of its assembly, was the cause of significant environmental changes in western Mexico, and required one of the most widespread use of amnestics to date. Post-event, the active components of SCP-001 were taken to Foundation sites for containment, while the inactive component of SCP-001 remained on the bottom of the Gulf of California, at approximately 23.807269, -108.418369.
Addendum 001.01: Collected Information Describing SCP-001

Transcription of statement by Father Jorge Castillo, August 1945

Fernand was the first… I think, the first who contacted me after they had found the heart. The way they described it, the fervor that was in their eyes, it captivated me and I knew then. I knew that they had done it.

I went to meet with Anthony and Salvador the weekend after my sister's confirmation… when they showed it to me I was taken aback. It was little more than a pile of gears, pistons, ticking pieces of clockwork and lubricated metal parts, all dutifully churning along without a power source. Within it I saw the heart, just as they described.

It spoke to me.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Not like you and I would speak to each other, but… with images, and feelings. And pain. It was in so much pain. Like the spark that had given it life had made it realize what it was, or what it wasn't, and it desired only to be whole again.

Desire is a strong word, perhaps. Not desire, more than it was impulse. Something within the creature drove it forward towards some unthinking, unfaltering end. The creature they presented to me was not like the other artifacts I had found and blessed. This one was different, there was something wrong with it, and I did not know until later what they had done…

I begged Salvador to take it back to that beach and undo it, that it was not right, but they would hear nothing of it. It started moving before I left, shaking enough from side to side that it could achieve locomotion. It hobbled over a wrench, and the wrench became part of its body. They said to me, "Our God is unbroken!"

I never saw them again.

Excerpt from an interview with Francis Bollinger in 1946

It didn't use words, or any kind of language. It would make metallic sounds but at the same time… Images and concepts would come to mind when we were around it. Have you ever felt, when you have a thought or idea— and it's all there, born whole in your mind— you still had to think the words for it, despite knowing the sentiment before you finish the sentence? It was like that, but from an alien mind. Truly the words of the divine.

Excerpt from an interview in 2007 with Trixie Silva, agent of the Unusual Incidents Unit

There were a few Wolves — wait, you know what those are, right? They're like… like hunters, they work for the Horizon Initiative. They confronted us near a church in Santa Margarita, wanted us to turn in the stuff that we had collected for the Church of the Broken God, like the Abrahamic stuff we handed over.

We deliberated on whether we should give it to them — our stance with the HI has been a bit shaky, moreso in recent memory.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" While we have been on good terms with the local Broken Churchgoers, the Wolves were more… well, are more aggressive. We looked over what we had, and while we did, this woman walked up. I don't know where she came from. She dressed like a hippie; thin, iron chains for hair, but she seemed distant the whole time. The look in her eyes, her abnormal smile, like she was hardly there.

She looked at what we had and said she only wanted this, uh. I don't actually know what it was. A metal box, it whirred and clicked, and put out this little beam of light on one end when I picked it up. Felt lighter than I would have thought. I asked why that was important to her, and she said that it'd be easier to show me than tell.

She closed her eyes and bowed her head. She didn't move or speak after that, so I closed my eyes as well. She brought her forehead to mine, but kind of offset. We stood like that for a second, foi muito estranho, before she suddenly moved her chin down, made me jerk down slightly.

The world dropped beneath me and I fell. Something clicked in my mind, an image of two gears, formerly meshed together, now broken away. I felt the teeth of my spine arch out as I bent over, one step and I clicked along on the multidimensional cog that was the planet. It spun around the furnace of the sun, tethered to it by the chain that was gravity, and we hurtled together through an oily cosmos with all the power of an infinitely unwinding spring…

…S-sorry. It was an experience. No, it was not a religious experience, but… yeah. She told me to pick the box back up and it felt a lot heavier than before. I couldn't tell if it actually had more weight, or if it felt more… significant. I gave it to her and wouldn't hear anything otherwise from the Wolves or my teammates or my superior.
Addendum 001.02: Interview with Excommunicated Church of the Broken God priest Father Dolorous Randall, June 1945
[EXTRANEOUS DIALOGUE REMOVED]

Williams: Alright. You mentioned the heart earlier.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Were you there when they found it?

Randall: No, not at all. I was out of the country at the time, working with a new mission in Panama. I only heard about Ezekiel after the fact.

Williams: Who was Ezekiel?

Randall: One of Bumaro's agents. Before he was made leader of the church, Robert would keep a number of them around, these individuals who were in tune with God and could feel its presence, speak to it. Ezekiel had discovered an artifact of some value, and Bumaro took him on afterwards. These agents were the first to experiment with the augmentations, as well. As you can imagine, many of them died.

Williams: But not Ezekiel?

Randall: No. He was very close to Bumaro, and I don't know if he would have risked Ezekiel's well-being. It doesn't matter, Ezekiel didn't need augmentations to speak to the God. He was just… capable.

Williams: So what does Ezekiel have to do with the heart?

Randall: You heard Avery tell you that they had a stockpile of artifacts, right? Anything that one of these agents touched, if they felt something they would have it shipped to La Paz with the rest of it. Most of it was worthless, but every now and then they would find something legitimate. The purifier, the one— whatever you call it, one of the agents discovered that near Nepal. They had tendons and ligaments and everything else, but they were all just parts. They would move on their own, but they didn't do anything together.

Williams: How do you mean?

Randall: The texts refer to the God reassembling itself once the pieces are brought before its heart. All you need do is to feed the heart a limb, and the God will have a limb. But they couldn't find a heart. There were (pauses) a couple of agents who had claimed to have found one, but they were all the same useless piece of machinery as the rest.

Williams: Where does Ezekiel figure into this?

Randall: Ezekiel was the one who told Bumaro that, if they could not find a heart, maybe they could build one of their own.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" This, at the time, flew directly in the face of the Church doctrine. The leadership, if they had known, would have excommunicated him. But it was quickly becoming clear that the project couldn't last through to the summer. I was sent in with my mission to resupply them after Ezekiel had left, and their supplies were nearly exhausted.

Williams: Our records indicate that the heart was something they discovered. Is that not true?

Randall: Of course it isn't true. You can't preach to a congregation about God giving parts of himself to you and then turn around and tell them that the most essential part is something you conjured up out of nothing. Worse than nothing, though. The details of what they did to create that heart and make it live were never revealed to me, but you can draw conclusions from evidence. There was a drought that year, and the polio crisis hit an all time high. Thousands died, all of natural causes. A freak event, never accurately recorded because of the attention on the war. Dios mio, but who can say.

Williams: You think the two are related?

Randall: I think the timing is too coincidental. And knowing what I know about what that thing became, I think the answer is clear. That was not the heart of God, agent. That was something altogether different.

Video recovered from local documentary film crew.

Shot begins on a destroyed home, the wreckage centered around the garage. Metal fragments and strips of rubber trail down the driveway and onto the asphalt, and go down the street. Pieces of various automobiles are strewn across the street and sidewalk. The trail leads to SCP-001, which is integrating a truck into its chassis.

SCP-001 continues to the nearest house, where it begins consuming the gutters. Residents of the area flee the scene, several injured by discarded shards of glass and twisted metal discharged by SCP-001.""")

The ejected subsection continues alterations, forming a vertical pod somewhat resembling a human spine and rib cage. Pod collapses in various areas, the rib-like protrusions extending outward as the rest of the pod changes into a humanoid form roughly three meters tall. Light is produced from the head, which is focused on a nearby civilian.

The metal humanoid picks up the civilian, who appears to be dead, and places it into a small chamber between the humanoid's ribs. The ribs vibrate as the humanoid approaches a second civilian, who is attempting to crawl away. She attempts to struggle as the humanoid lifts her and places her inside its chest cavity. The humanoid turns away from the camera to approach a third civilian, and what appears to be the woman's dismembered hand falls to the floor.

A growth on the humanoid's back slowly expands as it continues to gather bodies, the body of the humanoid decreasing in size as it does so. By the sixth consumed body the growth is larger than the humanoid, and it is unable to continue bipedal movement. The limbs recede into the body and the ribs extend to allow it to scuttle onto the roof of a nearby house.

It remains in place for twenty minutes. The bulbous exterior cracks and is torn away from within, revealing three humanoids. They each appear to be symptomatic of SCP-217, and exhibit physical characteristics of the six captured civilians. One, a female with chains extending from its scalp, shakes another, which appears to be dead. The third, a male with clockwork limbs, examines itself before jumping from the roof, landing on its stomach. It does not appear to be damaged by this, which seems to cause it distress.""")

Bumaro: Hello?

Agent: Bless you father.

Bumaro: Dmitri?

Agent: No.

Bumaro: He's being fed?

Agent: As you required.

Bumaro: Good. When will you be moving to Peñasco?

Agent: Within the week. We are only waiting for the next train.

Bumaro: It may need to be sooner. There was a raid in La Paz two weeks ago. Three of our men have not been accounted for. There is growing Foundation activity nearby— (cuts out momentarily)

Agent: Father?

Bumaro: (To someone in the background) Tomorrow, tomorrow.

Agent: Father?

Bumaro: Yes. We had expected them to head north, but they've come west instead. A minor setback.

Agent: What about the safehouse? There are nearly a hundred other artifacts there, and—

Bumaro: (Cuts off) A minor setback. They don't know where it is, and even if they did, that isn't their priority right now. Their eyes, and the eyes of the rest of the world, are on Europe. As their gaze settles there, they will not realize our accomplishment until they are powerless to stop him.

Bumaro: Nonsense. The heart of the devout may speak directly to our God. Can you not hear his words when he reaches out to you? Do you not feel the machine moving inside of you? Or do you need more proof other than the living, breathing God before your own eyes?

Agent: No! Father, it is not that, it is—

Bumaro: I will hear nothing of it. For years, we have prayed and asked for our God to be unbroken before us. And now, he has presented himself. We know that the divine will speak to the heart of the devout. If you are telling me that there are none among you who are devout enough to commune with our Lord, tell me now so you can be replaced.

Agent: Our faith is strong, Father. Please, forgive my insolence. I am only misguided.

Bumaro: See to yourself, then. I worry for your faith. Have one of your brothers, one who is stronger than you, have him speak to the Lord and tell him of the necessity for secrecy. Our Lord will understand, no doubt. The Unbroken God is a reasonable god.

Addendum 001.05: Escalation Report, December 1943

The following is an interview conducted with Foundation Commander Mark Peterson of Site-74. The director, who prior to the 001-Apotheosis Event was stationed in Mexico City, was on-site with Foundation personnel in La Paz during the Event.

Director Cornwell: Start again from the top, we're recording now.

Commander Peterson: Alright. The first reports we got about Church activity in Mexico were in '41, but it was all pretty minor at the time. We had just finished field operations near the border up north and were preparing to move our assets to Atlanta for deployment to France.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" We had just gotten our orders to retrieve a series of sensitive objects that they didn't want to get into the hands of the krauts, and they were going to move our entire division to get it done. Leadership wasn't sure that Roosevelt would make the call to move in enough time for us to blend in with the Americans, so we were going to have to go in separately. The whole thing was a mess.

Director Cornwell: What kept you in La Paz?

Commander Peterson: I was there on accident. One of our trains had taken the overland route to La Paz, probably to pick up some of the armaments we had there. Turns out that train was supposed to head north. So all of a sudden most of the leadership south of the Rio Grande is in La Paz, which in retrospect probably did us a lot of good as far as the overall effort is concerned.

Director Cornwell: When did you first hear about the 001-Apotheosis Entity?

Commander Peterson: (Laughs) Jesus. Is that what they're calling it now? The machine, I guess, we first heard through the grape vine of increased activity in the area in… I guess it would've been a little over a year ago. We ended up in La Paz in October of '42, so… yeah, that sounds right. The first concrete evidence we got that something was wrong was when a train of… refugees? Seems kind of silly to call them that, but I guess that's accurate. They showed up in La Paz near the end of October, talking about how their entire town had been mulched. They didn't really elaborate much, just kept saying "la máquina, la máquina," you know, "the machine". That's why we were calling it that, by the way. We had no idea what it was supposed to be.

Director Cornwell: What about your first interaction with the entity?

Commander Peterson: Well, the rail stopped running, if that's what you mean. We got word from the local authorities that there had been an accident up north, and that the trains weren't heading to the border anymore.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" It wasn't a huge issue for us, since we could've taken a couple of vehicles and headed east until we hit one of those little towns at the foot of the mountains. Most of them were hooked up to a separate rail line entirely, and we could've gotten out that way. But the big stuff, the stuff that the train had been sent to La Paz for, couldn't just be moved. So we were going to wait it out. Then DeMarco had the bright idea to send a party up the rail-line to see where the hold up was, and see what we could do to clear it. He led the expedition himself.

Director Cornwell: What happened to Agent DeMarco?

Commander Peterson: You know damn well what happened to him, Bill.

Director Cornwell: For the record.

Commander Peterson: Fine. We didn't hear back from them after three days, and were going to send the rest of the leadership east anyway so they didn't have to wait, but then after five days one of DeMarco's guys showed up at our camp. He was delirious, talking about the "world eater", and how the rest of the guys had gotten mulched. And they had, hadn't they? I know it wasn't as big then as it ended up, but it wasn't something to fuck around with. DeMarco…

Director Cornwell: Are you alright?

Commander Peterson: Yeah. He tried to kill it. He probably knew then what we wouldn't find out until later; that we couldn't contain this thing. There wasn't a hole in the world big enough to put it in, or a box that it wouldn't eat its way out of. But it didn't matter for him, or anyone he went with. The Machine didn't care.

Director Cornwell: When did you first see it?

Commander Peterson: December. Once we'd hunkered in, I was part of an expeditionary team that flew up there to get a good look at it. It was already… I mean, you saw what it did to that side of the country. I've never seen anything that big that could move. It was like a mountain of moving parts, blackening the sky as it burned through whatever it was shoveling into its chest.""")

Note: The following are excerpts from written correspondences by Foundation personnel stationed at La Paz, recovered from the temporary site in the wake of the 001-Apotheosis Event. Names have been omitted.
Dear ███████,

I don't even know if this will get to you. None of the trains are running, but our commander says that we can still get letters out. I hope it does, I'd like you to read it.

The skies down here have been dark for weeks. Smoke from up north every day, makes it hard to breathe. They still don't have indoor plumbing here, and nobody but the other guys in our company speak English.

We still don't know what we're down here to do, either. I keep hearing we're here to fix the rails, but why aren't we going north? Aren't the breaks in the rails up north?

A man came into town today with damn near half of his face cooked off. He was like a dead-man, didn't respond to anybody. He got towards the middle of town and collapsed. When he finally woke up in the infirmary later, he was delirious. Telling a story about a machine the size of a mountain that spoke to you. Said there were people jumping out of their homes and running, just to throw themselves in it. Said they were shredded, like jumping under a lawn-mower. Then he died, and nobody knows why.

The mountains crumbled before our own eyes. We saw a figure rising through the smoke, slow and lumbering but with terrifying momentum. It didn't crawl like a beast or walk like a man, but was propelled forwards by the turning of a million cogs, like an iron centipede. Its body extended upwards, into the smoke, higher than we could make out.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Within its chest we saw fire, like the furnaces of Hell. It came to the mountains north of us and did not stop, or go around, but went through, and devoured them. It reached out with a long, pulsing arm, and pulled an entire village into its maw. I saw men leaping to their death as their homes were swept away, into the same inferno as the rest. And it howled, not just through the grinding of the gears and the churning of the machine, but in our minds. I could hear it in my heart. It was screaming.

Addendum 001.07: Interview with GOC Lieutenant "Revenant"

Note: The following is an excerpt of a post-event interview conducted with a GOC lieutenant, codenamed "Revenant". The recording of the interview, and all transcripts thereof, were collected by Foundation agents during a negotiated information exchange in 1992. To date, the identity of "Revenant" is unknown.

There's this story that gets told among Foundation agents, something that the grizzled veterans will tell the greenhorns during the long nights of guard duty on some cell block or another. I don't know who started it, but I know they still tell it. It's been a half-century, and they still get it right. You can give them that much credit.

They say, "Don't you know? The GOC killed God."

But the greenhorns will say, "No, that's not true. God is in a cell at site-whatever. The GOC didn't kill God." And they're talking about that type green they've got locked up somewhere, the one who thinks he's the Christian god. Then the vets will smile and shake their heads, and won't say anything. Because they all know.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

They know that in 1943, in the midst of the Apocalypse, the Foundation could do nothing but watch the end while the Allied Occult Initiative, a poorly funded, undermanned, inadequate predecessor to the Coalition, saved the world.

The metaphorical gun was found on an island off the coast of Greece. I can't even remember what it looked like, all I get is that sort of fuzzy recollection the amnestics leave you with. But I distinctly recall it wasn't as heavy as you'd think.

Why the amnestics? I was with the detachment deployed to the area, and apparently one of the pieces had some mind altering effect to it. I have a vague sense of feeling something wrong, so I'll take their word for it. I don't remember what it looked like, I can't recall how it destroyed that much land. Hell, I barely remember when it happened and the only reason I know where is all the before and after maps. But I can still feel it, in my gut, that that wasn't how things were meant to be. We stood before what looked to be an angry and vengeful God, and all it did was beg us to kill it.

We were all too happy to oblige.

Addendum 001.09: Neutralization of SCP-001

On July 17th, 1943, agents from the Allied Occult Initiative contacted Foundation directors stationed at La Paz, Mexico, and requested assistance with transportation towards the site of the 001-Apotheosis entity. Foundation operatives moved quickly to dispatch a plane to retrieve the AOI members. After arriving, the agents described a unique anomalous artifact they had in their custody, and how it might be used to slow the advance of the 001-Apotheosis entity.

Three days after arriving at La Paz, on July 24th, 1943, the Allied Occult Initiative dispatched a single agent to the site of the 001-Apotheosis entity, with the anomalous artifact on their person. On the morning of July 25th, 1943, as the 001-Apotheosis entity approached the shore of the Pacific Ocean another massive, mechanical construct4 appeared overhead. The origin of this entity is currently unknown.

Records of the event following the appearance of SCP-2399 are incomplete and likely inaccurate. The result of this engagement was the annihilation of SCP-001. SCP-2399 disappeared and was later discovered in low-Jupiter orbit in a state of disrepair, though the reason for this is currently unknown.

The remaining inactive component of SCP-001, a massive, unassembled group of machine parts, remains at the bottom of the Gulf of California. Upon removing SCP-882 from the inactive superstructure, the remainder collapsed and became wholly inert.""")

Following the 001-Apotheosis Event, a massive amnesticization of individuals in and around the area now known as Baja California took place. These efforts were aided by the quantity of thick, black smoke that accompanied SCP-001, and current historical records describe the event as a forest fire. Significant effort was made to adjust maps of the area, as well as relocate displaced civilians. Because of the need for a widespread amnestic regimen, several experimental neurotransformers were used5, and because of their poorly understood side effects, it is estimated that no fewer than two million people across the world died in the decade following the 001-Apotheosis Event.

Report Length: 57 pgs

Summary of Report: On December 30th, 1942, a rogue humanoid entity, anomalous in nature, was sighted by a patrol near a small island off the coast of Greece. This entity, who claimed no name and did not communicate readily in the English tongue, was carrying a small, cubic artifact no larger than a baseball. The entity appeared to be feminine and had a number of steel chains extending from its scalp.

Entity was originally willing to give up possession of artifact (classified AR-213), but became hostile shortly thereafter and began speaking. Entity made threats on the lives of the squad, and subdued two officers before being incapacitated by Sergeant Dixon. Entity made reference to the west of the Mexican country, demanding to be freed so that the artifact could be taken there.

Further research has uncovered increased SCP Foundation activity in that area, as well as some minor geological disturbances. On the orders of Colonel Baghram, 2nd Platoon was ordered to ship to the site of the disturbances with the entity (classified EN-340) in tow.""")

Addendum 001.11: Agent Ruberson's Statement, January 1944

Note: Agent Aaron Ruberson was on-site during the collection of SCP-001 artifacts. As the most senior member of Foundation staff assigned to the collection effort, he was required to submit a post-event statement. This report was filed at Site-17, until it was added to the other classified material related to SCP-001. It is unknown whether any other individuals had knowledge of this report, or if any copies were made. The following is an excerpt from that statement.

We took what we could from the shores first. Little things, gears and pulleys and pistons, things like that. A lot of it was garbage, but they were still twitching, spinning, turning. They still had life in them. The small stuff sort of died off after a couple hours, but I heard that the bigger pieces were still churning weeks later. Like cutting the head off a chicken.

The important parts, the ones we knew were actual Church artifacts, we managed to bag and get moved to the train in La Paz for transport. I counted, Christ, maybe a hundred? Individual anomalous artifacts. Some of the boys at the train station joked that they'd have to build a whole new site just to keep it all.

We kept casualties low, fortunately. Mostly guys just being dumb around machinery, acting like it still couldn't take their arms off. Rodriguez got his hand crunched, and we had to help move him to the local clinic. I think we only had one death the entire time.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" One of the locals we hired to help dive down into the bay and get straps around the heart so we could pull it up. I didn't see it, but I heard about it. Said they found him with his head smashed between two moving pieces. Said it looked like he'd shoved it in there himself.

But I don't know, I didn't see it. I did see the tags, though.

You know, when a place manufactures something, and in order to identify where the part came from, they'll get a big piece of metal with their name on it and stick it on the side of the part? We saw plenty of those on other parts, the stuff that it had collected while it was eating its way to the sea. None of the Church artifacts did, though. They all buzzed along like everything else, but they weren't marked. You could feel something when standing next to them, like serenity. The whole project was like that, it felt calm. Like relief.

Except for the heart. When we finally got it out of the bay, we had to keep it on the shore for a day because of the weather. Some of the locals started to get itchy. Said they were hearing voices, wouldn't go near it. Didn't matter how much money we offered them. Had to wait to bring in more support from the base up north just to get it loaded on a ship.

I… man, I don't know. I've seen all kinds of things, but my memetic resistance is pretty high. I had to pass a handful of tests just to get this assignment, and everything was clean. But I can't deny getting another kind of feeling around the heart. I don't know if I'd say I was hearing voices, but…

Right, the tags. It was as we were leaving and loading it on the ship that was going to take it north that I saw them for the first time. I didn't even think to say anything then, didn't even pass my mind until I started looking into some other files. Then that ship crashed in the storm, and they lost the heart, and the whole time I kept thinking about those goddamn metal tags. I realized it then, I think.

Addendum 001.12: Interview with POI-004D/001

Note: The following is an excerpt from an interview in 2009 with POI-004D/001, who claims to be part of a previously unknown sect of the Church of the Broken God. Contact was made with the cooperation of the Unusual Incidents Unit, who had interacted with POI-004D/001 as detailed in Addendum 001.01.

So, tell me what you think you know.

I see.

Interesting.

Well, you're not entirely wrong. And that's commendable, in this day and age. There are a few key details I feel you may be overlooking, and you may be overvaluing information handed to you by a self-admitted amnesiac.

Let me set the record straight.

The GOC did not kill Yahweh, as they may so proudly proclaim. And that was not the Broken God they destroyed. It was a piece of it, surely, but would you show me a camshaft and call it a car? Oh, so you have some parts together. An engine, perhaps. But not a car.

God is much simpler than that. God is everything. From the biggest star to the smallest particle. Each tiny parts, completely insignificant on their own. Doing whatever it is they're meant to do. Meshing together, gnashing at each other. All a part of a cosmic machine.

The machine aspect was, at some point, likely simply a metaphor. An idea. But as I'm sure you know, ideas are powerful. They make things from nothing, or change things already there. And with a small spark of the divine, a symbol becomes real. Have a planet with as much life as there is here, you generate a lot of ideas.

And you may ask me, "Why is it called the Broken God?" There are a few possible answers. Something as simple as translation issues. Reinterpretations made physical by the devout. Is "Broken" simply a poor translation of some more nuanced word? Was God a being that broke in the Big Bang? If so, why did it break? And what will happen if it's repaired?

I can answer none of the questions save the last, but you already know the answer.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Whatever God once was doesn't matter, ultimately. What matters, to you, is that it must remain as it is. "Broken." God knows that. The more powerful parts, the mechanical components the more conventional sects may label as holy, they know they are not meant to be one solid thing. And even when forced together, a foreign force driving them, they know what they really are. Bits of the monster will work to destroy itself, deploy smaller entities to do the job. The GOC didn't kill it, they took the gun from its own hand and claimed credit when they pulled the trigger.

The problem is that humans are too small a part of God to remember. Remember what it was like before. And so those like Bumaro will invent new ways to push us toward a singularity.

Because that's what will happen. Did you see the underside of the destroyer? It was damaged even before the encounter in '43. And if you looked very closely, you might have seen the scars were getting closer and closer to the power core. It even managed to damage whatever lets it slip between the layers of reality this time. Eventually the monster will win. It will destroy the destroyer, devour it, and with its power consume everything. And I mean everything. God will return to being one gestalt being, a singularity, and then break. Only this time it may have some outside force within it. The rust of The Factory. The blood of a Daevite king. The Fifthists, Wondertainment, some random person on the street with enough spark in them to be a reality bender. They will have a hand in remaking the universe, and close the secondary loop of all this.

No, that doesn't concern me. It's an eventuality, it's meant to happen. Who's to say it hasn't already happened, and your people were the winner? Maybe humanity itself was the winner. But that doesn't mean I'd be against putting it off, allowing the primary loop to continue.

Yes, it's possible.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" I know you couldn't damage the monster last time, and that the destroyer may not be able to repair itself by the time it is needed. But who's to say you can't aid it? Or mimic those who will seek to rebuild God, and acquire outside help? Working together, nothing is impossible.

Apart, we are Broken. But united, we are God.

Description: SCP-001 is a humanoid gravitational singularity currently contained within the Area-11 Pietrykau-Fontaine Array. SCP-001 is immeasurably dense; only by mitigating its effect on spacetime through the use of Scranton-Kempf devices are Foundation personnel able to maintain the structural integrity of the Spatial Stabilization Array. SCP-001 is not visible without specialized equipment (usually high-contrast infrared cameras), as it is constantly surrounded by a dense cloud of radioactive gas and atomized debris. Additionally, being a singularity, SCP-001 does not reflect light, and is visible only by the obfuscation of light around it.

SCP-001 is capable of manipulating the nature of reality through alterations in gravity that change the shape and structure of spacetime. As such its anomalous capabilities cannot be dampened by anything other than the Pietrykau-Fontaine array3, any alterations to spacetime made by SCP-001 are irreversible.

Addendum 001.1
Initial Manifestation

On June 19th, 1982, a team of Foundation researchers headed up by Dr. Lamar Fontaine4 were in the process of running engineering trials on the Pietrykau-Fontaine Spatial Stabilization Array, a device intended for use in containing anomalies that manipulate the nature of spacetime5. During these trials, a particle accelerator was used to create superheavy oganesson, which would in turn collapse on itself to create a miniaturized singularity. This procedure had been carried out on several other occasions, with each of the singularities destabilizing quickly after manifesting. The June 19th trial was intended as a scale up test of the procedure.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Shortly after 2030 hours local time, as the particle accelerator was in the process of spooling up, Dr. Calvin Desmet, one of the project's research assistants, noted minor power fluctuations in one arm of the array's stabilizing rings. Dr. Desmet wanted to replace the failing coupling, which was known to decay under the cold temperatures of the testing chamber. Since the test was still an hour away and the chamber was not sealed, Dr. Desmet entered to repair the coupling. As the accelerator continued to spool, a power regulator attached to the system's primary generator began to fail6. Under non-test conditions this event could still flood the chamber with ionizing radiation, so an evacuation order was given and the chamber was sealed. Dr. Desmet, not hearing the alert over the sound of the array coming online (due to the excess power now present in the system), continued to work on the coupling.

Roughly seven minutes later, while outside research staff were attempting to begin a power-down cycle, the power regulator failed entirely and the accelerator began powering to near-test conditions. Dr. Desmet abandoned the power coupling and attempted to escape the test chamber. Before he could make it to an emergency exit, the accelerator reached peak test conditions and a singularity formed. The array pulled the singularity into alignment, but only milliseconds before the damaged stabilizer arm failed and Dr. Desmet was exposed to the naked singularity. The test chamber collapsed into the singularity, as did much of the rest of the research wing and Dr. Desmet himself. Shortly afterwards, the singularity dissipated.

In the wake of the June 19th incident many administrative personnel at Area-11 were reassigned, while engineering staff and Foundation construction teams worked to repair the damaged portions of the facility (which was at the time still housing several other anomalies).""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" This effort continued for several years, during which time significant control portions of the stabilization array were removed and replaced with autonomous systems7 in order to reduce staffing and also limit exposure. The engineering team assigned to the stabilizer began running tests of its capabilities starting in March of 1995.

Over the next several years the teams at Area-11 ran minor tests of the stabilizer, typically in an attempt to reduce energy requirements and increase automation. By 2002, the system was almost entirely automated, requiring only a handful of support staff to operate. The array began containing minor gravitational anomalies starting in 2004, and continued to do so full-time up until 2005. In late 2005, staff members at Area-11 began trials that would lead towards testing the stabilizer on a free-standing singularity.

In early 2006, aided by the NETZACH intelligence system8, on-site engineers began scaling up their trials into fully-operational experiments. After several months of testing, in May of 2006, the engineers at Area-11 manifested a singularity within the array at full power, and maintained the structural integrity of both the singularity and the containment chamber.

However, after two hours of testing with a fully stable singularity, the space within the array began to change dramatically. The singularity began to rapidly grow in size, threatening to expand past the boundaries of the array. As the automated system initiated an evacuation warning, NETZACH began making adjustments to account for the significant increase in energy being exerted by the singularity. Eventually the growth rate of the singularity stalled, and the effects it had on the containment chamber were mitigated through alterations to the array's arrangement by NETZACH. It was at this point that the thick cloud of rotating radioactive gas and dust formed, obscuring the singularity within.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

As Foundation engineers began work to reinforce the damaged array, SCP-001 made its first attempt at communication with Foundation staff. This initial communication attempt consisted primarily of unintelligible noises, initially became full sentences and then later conversations after Foundation personnel discovered that the singularity within the gas cloud was humanoid in shape and, though unmoving, clearly attempting to speak to them.

First Contact

First contact between SCP-001 and the Foundation was conducted by Dr. J. Barton Ramsey, Site-17, at SCP-001's containment array beneath Area-11. Notably, SCP-001 does not appear capable of communicating naturally; its incredible density makes the projection of sound impossible. Instead, SCP-001 uses gravity to vibrate the suspension rings of the array in order to create sound9.

It almost seems unnecessary but… to simplify this means of communication, you may identify me as Calvin Desmet. (Pauses) That seems strange. Applying characteristics to something wholly apart from their genesis.

O5-1: The same Calvin Desmet who was killed in this room twenty-two years ago?

SCP-001: No. Not the same. Similar, in many ways, but changed.

O5-1: You understand, then, how far in breach of protocol we are.

SCP-001: Yes, I think he would recognize that. But these are extraordinary circumstances.

O5-1: You mentioned a way out.

SCP-001: Yes, in a manner of speaking.

O5-1: A way out of what?

SCP-001: You contain the strange and anomalous because they threaten your world, but you're applying salve to symptoms. The root is entropy. Something inevitable. Something you cannot outrun, try as you might. Existence is an infinitely complex tapestry of realities, each neatly aligned above and below each other. Entropy frays the edges, and things begin to… leak through.

O5-1: How do you know this?

SCP-001: I have seen it. Calvin Desmet saw it, in the moment before his soul was cast into darkness. Everything you have contained because you cannot explain it comes from somewhere else, somewhere it can be explained. A different reality, one that seeps into yours. Entropy exacerbates this.""")

O5-1: How long do we have before this occurs?

SCP-001: Calvin did the math in the moments before he entered the void. Order cannot exist forever in a universe that lingers on disorder. One line can stretch on forever, but infinitely many lines invites chaos. Points that intersect. There is only one way to insure this world's future: remove all other worlds.

O5-1: I don't understand.

SCP-001: (Pauses) Yes.

O5-1: And you are capable of this?

Deliberations


 
O5-1: The Council has been called to hear arguments for and against the use of SCP-001 for the purpose of staving off the end of the world. O5-3, if you will.

O5-3: After investigation by several teams working independent of each other, we have determined that SCP-001 appears to be correct about what it has said regarding the nature of creation. The trend-line of anomalies we are aware of and have contained has followed the accelerated progression that SCP-001 predicted. Based on our models, we should expect an uncontainable number of new anomalies within 30 years, and even more past that. Our best guess is that something big gets loose within 45, and at that point there's nothing left to be done.

O5-7: How is that possible? How is it that the universe could fall apart as quickly as this entity says it will?

O5-1: According to Desmet, actions taken in other realities to stave off the end of their worlds have significantly damaged the metaphysical construction of all universes. In many ways, we are as much to blame as all of the others, but- (pauses) infinite blame spread over infinite responsible.""")

O5-6: What if it's just a reality bender? What if we let it out of that array and it kills us all?

O5-1: If it was a reality bender it would've done so already. This entity isn't manipulating humes; it's manipulating gravity. Spacetime. If it was affecting humes it could've just reached out and crushed us already; the Stabilization Array mitigates the effect of things that disturb spacetime, which is what is currently keeping it at bay. This entity, Dr. Desmet, if he's actually in there, doesn't seem to be a Type Green. It's something wholly different. It's become something… fundamental, to the nature of all things.

O5-2: I- (pauses) If this creature is what it says it is, and it can do what it says it can do, that would mean the death of- of infinitely many lives. How can we sit in judgement over so many living things?

O5-4: Who's to say the idea of other universes isn't anomalous? Maybe there should just be this one. Maybe that's the natural order.""")

O5-3: We pledged ourselves to maintain normalcy and protect our world. This world. The affairs of other worlds are their own. We would expect any other Overseer Council to act the same way - in the interest of their universe. This, all of this, the science, the militarism, everything. All of it is to accomplish a single, unreachable goal. Keep the monsters tucked out of sight. Now we find out, even that might not be enough. That the end of days is coming for us anyway. But we're given an option: if we do nothing, every universe dies screaming. If we take this action, every universe dies screaming but ours. Once it's over, it's over. Everything we've struggled for, everyone who has died to protect our world will be validated. Is the end of our road not worth this? Is protecting ourselves from the doomsday to come not worth this?

O5-1: Those opposed?

O5-9, -2, -7, -8: Nay.

We've now risked everything for the faintest glimmer of hope that we somehow achieve the last, and I fear it will have damned us. (Pauses) Why do you trust it, Bramimond? After all we've achieved, why do you risk everything on this?

O5-1: I knew Calvin Desmet, years ago. In a different life. He wasn't recruited by the Foundation - he volunteered. He was part of a team contracted by the Insurgency to run trials on new technology they were developing at the time.""")

Addendum 001.5
The Deception

On January 11th, 2007, after further discussion with SCP-001 and additional independent research, the Overseer Council voted 8-4-1 to initiate a power-down of the Spatial Stabilization Array and allow SCP-001 to take the action it had described. Three Overseers (O5-1, O5-4, and O5-12) were in attendance. As a sign of good faith, an anomalous artifact (SCP-884) was selected and SCP-001 was directed to target the reality in which the artifact had originated. O5-3 oversaw the artifact during this process.

[BEGIN VIDEO LOG]

O5-1, -4, and -12 stand alone in the Stabilization Array's control center. Visible on another screen is the dark cloud of gas and dust encircling SCP-001. O5-4 has a telephone in their right hand. They nod to O5-1.

O5-1: We're going to begin to step down the power running into the array. When we reach the agreed upon point, we'll hold it there until you can prove to us you can do what you claim. Do you understand?

SCP-001: I do.

O5-1 initiates step down procedure. NETZACH cycles down reactors 2 and 3. The cloud of radioactive dust and debris encircling SCP-001 falls into the borehole below it. Visible now as the light from the array is warped around it is a jet black humanoid entity. The entity does not move.

O5-1: This is it. Can you see me?

SCP-001: I can see everything.

O5-1: Do you know what you're looking for?

SCP-001: The mirror.

O5-1: Do it.

SCP-001 does not seem to respond initially. Its position in the center of the array does not change.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

SCP-001: The world I see is not unlike your own. In that world, a dying soul attached itself to that mirror; a curse to whoever should own it. (Pauses) It has happened.

There is a moment of silence, until O5-3 is heard over the radio.

O5-3: God…

O5-1: What is it?

O5-3: It's gone. It was sitting right here on the table, and then it just… it's like it folded in on itself until it was gone. There's nothing left.

O5-1: (To SCP-001) Was that you?

SCP-001: That narrative has ended.

O5-1: How long will it take?

SCP-001: Moments.

O5-1: Will it hurt them?

SCP-001: It will be agony.

O5-1: (Pauses, then nods)

The space around SCP-001 within the array begins to shimmer. Low, loud pulses of noise are emitted from the air around them, and the light within the chamber begins to bend in towards SCP-001. The array creaks and groans under the stress. O5-4 and O5-12 step away from the observation window. O5-1 does not move.

The building around them begins to shake. Points in the air around SCP-001 begin to distort, as if being dragged down individually towards SCP-001. The room darkens. More low pulses begin to rise up out of the borehole. A single, thin ring of white-hot debris begins to form around SCP-001. Others join it. Nearby, a klaxon can be heard as NETZACH warns of intolerable load on the array.

O5-1: Does it hurt you?

SCP-001: It is… excruciating.

Suddenly, O5-1 jerks backwards. The space around his body begins to distort, as if being pulled in towards his center. He reaches forwards towards the observation window, his body compressing unnaturally.

O5-1: (Choked) I don't-

SCP-001: (In O5-1's voice) If that's him in there, and he had found a way to remove every trace of the anomalous from our universe, no matter the cost, he would do it.

O5-1: Va-

SCP-001: (In its own voice) Your children free to live lives that do not end in horror. An end to your perpetual struggle. An end to darkness. The freedom to live in the light. All traces must be removed.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" (In O5-1's voice) …every trace of the anomalous from our universe. (In its own voice) This world must be washed clean. It is the only way out.

O5-1: (Gurgling)

O5-1 collapses in on himself, folding and distorting down into a single point that hangs in the air for a moment, and then disappears. All around the chamber, the walls begin to bend and distort. The air shimmers. O5-4 is lifted into the air, screaming, as her body begins to fold in on itself. Her eyes bulge and her bones audibly shatter. Another wave of force is emitted from within the stabilization array, and the observation window shatters. SCP-001 turns to look up at O5-4, who instantly crumples into a single point and then disappears. O5-12 stands to flee, but is seemingly frozen in fear.

There is a loud grinding sound, and then O5-12 falls to the ground. From within the containment chamber, a loud hum is heard that grows considerably louder. SCP-001 is observed for a moment more staring up at the observation deck, before it is surrounded by a cloud of dust and debris. As the array settles into position, the low pulsing sound dissipates and all that can be heard is the sound of NETZACH's warning klaxon, signalling that it has activated an emergency failsafe. O5-12 is heard sobbing in an unseen corner of the observation deck. SCP-001's voice begins to grind through the metal rings of the stabilization array.

SCP-001: (A dull, grinding roar) Your children free to live lives that do not end in horror. An end to your perpetual struggle. An end to darkness. The freedom to live in the light. All traces must be removed. This world must be washed clean. The Foundation does not escape atonement. It is the only way out.

Tredecim Protocol


 
~~In the event that SCP-001 breaches containment, the Tredecim protocol is designed to provide an extradimensional escape route for all high-ranking Foundation personnel to avoid annihilation at the hand of SCP-001.~~

We were wrong.""")

O5-3

There is a dark room under a mountain in the far north where a man stands pressed against a corner. Something is spinning in the center of that room, something dark. He screams out his daughter's name before his body is pulled from the wall and into the darkness. There is an explosion, and the room collapses.

Years earlier, the man lies broken in an alley, the fire escape he had dropped from still ringing from the shock. Inches away from his grasp, a little girl looks at him with horror in her eyes as she is approached by something that moves towards her slowly, one hand outstretched and fluid leaking from its empty eyes. The man reaches for the girl, but his body fails him. He is forced to sit and watch as the rotted corpse of a thing that might have been a man pulled the little girl into pieces. She screams until the thing removes her face, and then they disappear.

It is 1979. A breach of containment occurs involving a low-level reality bender who had killed three people in a car prior to being contained by filling their lungs with liquid mercury when they wouldn't let him pass during a traffic jam. The reality bender is shot and killed by Dr. Calvin Desmet, who later investigation would show was defending himself when the entity attacked him. There was, however, no surveillance footage found of the incident, and although the incident took place several floors up, the entity's containment cell seemed to have been broken into from the outside.

The investigation clears Dr. Desmet, who returns to work.

A man lingers on the edge of darkness for just a moment. His body is broken and his eyes burn. He sees the face of a little girl, her eyes bleeding and her hair being pulled back into the black maw of a dead-eyed corpse. He screams her name but he makes no sound.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The vision fades, and suddenly he sees infinitely many little girls - some of them dying but many more alive, growing old and never having to watch as she is consumed by a monster while her father watches, unable to do anything but weep.

He sees the monster, the dead-eyed thing, and traces a line in the air between the world he had left and another world - a world of filth and corrosion and death. He sees, if only for an instant, the thread between the two; a glowing fiber that draws them together. He looks past that thread and sees others, hundreds of thousands, millions, trillions, a number stretching towards infinity that he grasps all at once, and then he follows them down, back down towards his world.

In his mind's eye, he cuts the threads.

Years later, the man sees the threads again, though not now from the eyes of one tumbling into the darkness; instead he sees them from the eyes of a serrated knife.

In the moment before he is dragged back into a cage he reaches out and grabs not just the threads, but the spools where those threads originated. With one deft motion he pulls across them, splitting them and emptying their contents into the void beneath him. The threads disappear. He smiles.

The next morning, a note came from within SCP-1322. The translated message was simple: "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?"

The cost of what they had done became evident immediately. A hundred sites, large and small, all reported apparent abductions of valuable artifacts and entities. So many reported, in fact, that the Foundation's central computer determined they were experiencing a Dominance Shift, and began making preparations to move the records into deep storage. The order was quickly rescinded by Overwatch Command, who later issued a single line of text as an acknowledgement of what had happened.

The Foundation is currently experiencing unexpected shifts in reality. Do not panic.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

This did little, however, to assuage the fears of those who had watched as living anomalous entities had been crushed under the weight of something inconceivable into infinitesimally tiny points before disappearing altogether. Even worse, perhaps, were those who had watched their coworkers experience the same. Hundreds reported to site infirmaries around the globe. Dozens were dead - disappeared as if pulled by string into another place.

The news that morning was undisturbed, save for a few stories that might interest someone with insight. There was an explosion at a chemical plant near Istanbul, though investigators to the scene found nothing except a scorched foundation, a few overturned semi-trucks, and a banner that read "Dr. Wondertainment Inc: 1,000,000 safe man hours!" Billionaire Skitter Marshall had begun a massive selloff of his holdings, creating a panic in east Asian money markets. The Secretary General of the United Nations had announced the sudden and tragic death of long-serving Under-Secretary-General D.C. al Fine, who had perished when her private plane had gone down over the north Atlantic.

These and other stories littered local and national news the world over, but aside from a few strange incidents and unusual disappearances, nobody seemed to notice.

It is hours earlier. Around a table sit thirteen people. One of them puts her head in her hand.

"It still means the ends of so many lives. It's- it's too many to even comprehend. A number without limit."

Another voice answers. "A number without us."

O5-9 spits. "In another life, you might have been reasonable. This is unacceptable."

The rustling stops. From that dark corner, a man slumps forwards onto the ground. His throat has been slit. He is O5-1. The rest of them react with a start. O5-3 turns and draws a weapon.

"Who-" he says, but is cut off when another figure emerges from the shadow. It is O5-1. He is shaking, and his face is streaked with tears. One arms appears to have been crushed.

"I'm sorry," the man says, his voice now trembling. "I'm sorry. It said that if I came here, and I told you, it would spare my life. It would spare-"

A gunshot rings out across the chamber. Smoke floats from the barrel of a gun in O5-3's hand. Inches from O5-1's face, a bullet hangs in the air. The space around it appears strangely distorted. In seconds, it collapses into a point and disappears. O5-1 turns towards O5-3, his face warped with fear.

"Don't you see?" His words are panicked. "Don't you get it? You didn't contain him - you just put off the inevitable. He told me that my world would- would be spared, that I would be spared, if I could just convince-"

"Liar!" O5-9 shouts across the room, and she too pulls a gun. Another shot rings out, and she slumps over her desk, clutching her throat. O5-3 is pointing his gun at her, but he's staring at O5-1. His eyes are wide.

"Do you trust him?"

O5-1 smiles, but behind the smile is terror. "No. He will stop at nothing to achieve what he wants. He has power unlike any I've ever witnessed, but he- he is still a person. There's something inside him that still thinks. He said- he promised, promised that he would spare us." He swallows hard. "I don't want to die."

O5-1 turns back towards the rest of them. "I propose a vote.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The utilization of the SCP-001 entity to stave off the end of the world. All in favor?"

There is silence for a moment. Then, together, eight voices speak together. "Aye."

O5-1 nods. "Those opposed?"

Four voices, including one choking through blood to do so, answer together. "Nay."

O5-3 stands. He paces around the chamber, stopping at three desks. Every time he stops, there is a gunshot. Three bodies hit the ground. He pauses at a fourth, where O5-9 sits leaning against her chair, gun in her hand. For a moment, their eyes lock.

"Whatever comes next," he says, his voice catching, "it's no longer your battle to fight."

O5-9 glares at him with purified vehemence. She opens her mouth to speak, and through blood and bile she says two words.

"Spare me."

With a deft motion she pulls her gun under her own chin and squeezes the trigger. The chair behind her is sprayed with gore as her consciousness is snuffed out. O5-3 continues to stand over her, unmoving.

O5-1 speaks. "O5-13 abstains. The measure passes."

The rest of them stand and leave the room. O5-1 is second to last, and O5-3 lingers a moment longer. Five bodies stand in silent testament to their opposition. The room goes dark. Gunsmoke hangs in the air.

It is after. O5-3 stands before the shattered glass of an observation deck. Below him is a machine, furiously humming as it spins and twists around a nebulous cloud of darkness. Behind him is a smear of blood where O5-1 had been, moments before he was no longer. The structure around him creaks and groans, and small rivulets of water from the river above them now leak through the walls.

Without looking away, he speaks. "Netzach. Can you hear me?"

A low, electronic voices responds. "Yes."

"You aren't fitted with any sort of personality module, are you?"

"I am not."

He sighs. The rest of the staff had been evacuated. He was the only one left.""")

"How long can we maintain containment of SCP-001, given our current conditions?"

Netzach responds immediately. "Given current conditions, I will be able to maintain stability of the Pietrykau-Fontaine Array for one-hundred and nineteen days, six hours, and forty-seven minutes. Afterwards, the Array will no longer have the structural integrity necessary to contain SCP-001."

O5-3 rubs his forehead. "Given the information you've gathered about SCP-001, what do you think the odds are that our backup containment protocols will be able to neutralize SCP-001?"

Netzach pauses. "Given information gathered during containment of SCP-001, it is a certainty that SCP-001 will be undeterred by current failsafes."

"Full of good news today, Netzach." O5-3 sits down against a railing. "You need to give me something here."

"I am unable to provide a sufficiently psychologically useful response."

O5-3 waves his hand idly. "Yes, I know that. But you can problem solve, right? You're a problem solving robot. What would you do in my shoes?"

Netzach pauses again, and does not respond immediately. O5-3 notices the lights dim overhead, and somewhere far away he can hear a low, droning noise increase in volume. After a moment, it stops. Netzach speaks.

"All attempts to contain SCP-001 by way of brute force or standard means of containment, short of maintaining the Pietrykau-Fontaine Array, will fail. SCP-001 has, by methods currently unknown to this system, fused itself with a fundamental essence of the makeup of reality. It cannot be harmed or interfered with physically, as any such force that would oppose it requires the same forces to exist that SCP-001 is now joined to. SCP-001 will breach containment the moment the Pietrykau-Fontaine Array fails."

Netzach pauses a second time.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

"However," it continues, "SCP-001 does appear to be a sentient, sapient creature, likely formed out of the death of Dr. Calvin Desmet during an accident within this facility in 1982. While sentient, sapient creatures are often unpredictable and generally unwilling to compromise, diplomacy has historically been an effective means at bridging gaps between creatures with dissimilar goals and motivations."

O5-3 barks out a laugh. "You want me to talk to it? That's my best option?"

"Yes."

O5-3 stands up, still laughing. "You were worth the research dollars, Netzach. Honestly, that comment alone was worth every penny." He grabs his coat. "How about this. You watch Dr. Desmet, I'm going to go get a drink, and when I come back I'll go down there and talk to the Darkbody. It'll almost certainly mean both of our deaths, but it was only a matter of time anyway, wasn't it?"

He makes a move to the door, but hesitates. "You know, I've been thinking about that night in the council chambers. About the ones I put a bullet in. Sort of a turn of fortune for them, wasn't it?" He laughs again, more quietly this time. "When I joined the Foundation, someone told me to remain an atheist as long as I can, because I'll see so many gods and they'll all be selling something, but none of them will be the real deal. They said that I'll know the one true God when I see it, and to give that God everything it wants, because that's the only thing that matters."

He starts walking again. "That night, I saw God. That night, God wanted me to shoot O5-9, and by the sound of it, tonight God wants to talk to me. So hold down the fort, and I'll be back shortly to speak to him. Does that sound alright to you?"

Netzach drones out a reply. "I am unable to provide a sufficiently psychologically useful response."

O5-3 smiles as he walks out the door. "That's what I thought."

These grievances we hold against them:

THE THIRTEENTH OVERSEER - Has blasphemed the natural order in his foul contract to stay the hand of Death, and has usurped the fragile balance of life and given an impenetrable shield to the horrid adulterers of the Foundation.
THE TWELFTH OVERSEER - Has stolen the wealth of the world to benefit the Foundation’s insidious designs, and has taken the fruits of many millions for the purpose of turning those labors against the laborers.
THE ELEVENTH OVERSEER - Has spun a circle of lies around the people of this world to protect the Foundation’s interests, and has cast a dark eye onto the void to gaslight and pervert true human understanding.
THE TENTH OVERSEER - Has kept a dubious record of the Foundation's malfeasances and altered history to suit them, and has mocked truth and reason for the sake of maintaining the Foundation's cruel legacy.
THE NINTH OVERSEER - Has betrayed the trust of their fellow man and sworn allegiance to the cancerous council, and has time and time again turned away from opportunities to strike them down to prolong their greed-riddled intentions.
THE EIGHTH OVERSEER - Has committed wicked acts against the ignorant public with their careless use of nuclear weapons, and was one of the first to breathe life into an organization that should have been butchered in the crib.
THE SEVENTH OVERSEER - Has manipulated innocent populaces to create chaos and destruction for the Foundation’s benefit, and has shown nothing but contempt and malfeasance against the innocent and unwitting.
THE SIXTH OVERSEER - Has surreptitiously used the might of the American military machine to crush the Foundation’s enemies and wrought a tale of neverending violence and bloodshed that has forever stained this world.""")

THE FIFTH OVERSEER - Has warped the very boundaries between space and time to extend the Foundation’s cruel reach and taken dark and horrible secrets from those far-off places to use them to fuel the Foundation's death machine.
THE FOURTH OVERSEER - Has lulled the nations of the world into believing that the Foundation means them no harm while working alongside the same treacherous intentions that would see this planet laid to waste.
THE THIRD OVERSEER - Has used mankind’s own technologies against them to act as the all-seeing watcher of the Overseers, spinning a web of eyes that has eroded every last shred of human privacy and decency.
THE SECOND OVERSEER - Is complicit.
THE FIRST OVERSEER - Has established a council of monsters and demons that answer at his beck and call, all so he may sit on his foul throne atop the putrid wound of the Foundation and lap like a dog from its seeping, pustulent orifice.

The Overseers’ cancerous anomalous influence on the world is a wound on the fabric of the universe.

# CHAPTER I
## AT THE PRECIPICE

EARLIER

The proceedings came to order in the back room of an abandoned Somali warehouse.

Calvin sat at the head of a long plastic folding table, quietly picking at a fingernail. At the other end of the table were huddled the seven members of Delta Command, the high council of the Chaos Insurgency. Calvin had almost rolled his eyes when he’d been ushered into the room - for all their soaring rhetoric, they were still unable to come up with anything more substantial than dusty old buildings and cheap plastic furniture to conduct their business in.

Delta Command, he knew, had been formed by the Engineer to bring together the seven squabbling branches of what had once been called “The Insurgency”. Each of the seven groups sent a representative to Delta, and together they formed the larger resistance. The name was a joke, of course. According to legend, the Engineer had nearly given up trying to coordinate the bickering factions by saying “never in history has a more chaotic insurgency been mishandled into existence.” The name stuck, though Delta thought that “Chaotic Insurgency” wasn’t nearly distinguished enough. Thus, the Chaos Insurgency.

None of these people liked each other, nor did they care for Calvin. He’d had a distinguished career as a CI agent, first supporting and later leading larger attacks on the Foundation.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He, like all those within the Insurgency, knew their place in the world; the purpose of the Insurgency hadn’t ever been to destroy the Foundation, just act as a check against it. A constant thorn in their side, never allowing the Foundation to become too complacent. If they were focused on the Insurgency, the logic followed, they wouldn’t be able to do as much damage elsewhere. Thus far, this strategy hadn’t panned out.

But Calvin was exceptionally good at his job, and was less a thorn and more a hacksaw in the gut of the Foundation. His contributions to the Insurgency’s goals had brought him swiftly through their ranks, and at one point in the recent past he had been considered as the next member from his faction to join Delta. Shortly beforehand, however, he was accused of mishandling Insurgency resources - limited though they were - in a raid on a Foundation site holding several potentially magical texts.

Although the investigation against his actions hadn’t amounted to anything of note, the incident came at the absolute wrong time, and he was passed over for ascension to Delta in place of a mid-level bureaucrat who had previously been a junior congressman for the state of New Jersey, Howard Kowalski.

Coincidentally, it was Howard Kowalski who spoke first.

“Good afternoon, uh, Calvin,” the portly man said, balancing a pair of thin glasses on the end of his pointed snout. “We appreciate you, uh, making the trip out here. As you know, we’re in the middle of uh, renovations, to Delta Command Headquarters-”

This was, of course, a joke. Delta maintained that their former command center, the one built by the Engineer himself, was being renovated, necessitating the empty warehouses and dingy back-alley gatherings of the group. It was a public secret that the building had been leveled by the Global Occult Coalition nearly three decades prior, though Delta refused to acknowledge this.

“-so this will have to do, I think. Yes.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""” He nodded, and tapped a stack of papers against the desk. “I guess what we’re most curious about here, Calvin, is this uh, well, this document we hear you’ve recovered.” He leaned forward, the glare from a lamp catching his glasses as he peered over the stack of papers. “The journal. Do you have it?”

Calvin nodded. “If you allow me a moment of your time, I promise, we’ll talk about the journal.”

One of the other members of Delta, a tall, long-haired woman named Norris, made a sound in the back of her throat. “Don’t test our patience, boy. It’s bad enough that we had to suffer the journey out here, but I swear to god if we did it so you could bullshit around with some fake book, I’ll have your job.”

Kowalski laughed nervously as Calvin raised an eyebrow at the outburst. “Now now, Priscilla,” Kowalski said cautiously, “let’s just hear what he has to say. Calvin has uh, really done a lot for our organization, I think we can all agree-” grudging nods were had all around, “-and I think he deserves the uh, the benefit of the doubt, here.” He motioned Calvin to go on.

Calvin picked up his own sheaf of papers and opened it up. “Alright, so what you’re seeing in front of you is something I’ve been working on with a few people over the last few months - call it a statement of purpose. We’ve been working in conjunction with Dr. Vernon Alderman’s lab in Sydney, and the results of his team’s work has been… troubling. The Foundation’s continued testing of unnatural entities and phenomena has exacerbated the problem caused by those same entities - they’re itching at a wound. Couple that with the knowledge we gained from Lieutenant Horver’s team regarding Scranton Anchor calibration shifts in the last few years, and the evidence is clear.” He paused, and flipped to the next page. “We’re quickly reaching a point of no return.”

He scanned down further on the page.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “Now, our current models estimate that we might not make it out of the 2020s without a major, public, supernatural event, and then not even another five years past that before we start seeing things too big for even the Foundation to deal with. That’s not good, and is the reason why we need to address this now - if we wait any longer, we might not be able to do anything of any value.”

Sylvester Sloan, the oldest member of Delta, hacked out a queer cackle. “Our value comes in inhibiting the Foundation’s efforts. What it sounds like you’re about to say is that you intend to interrupt them entirely.”

Calvin leaned back slightly. “More than that. I intend to uproot the Foundation, leaf and stem.”

A thick silence plopped down over the group, as if someone had just thrown a rotten egg into an elevator. Herman Van Gandry, another one of Delta’s veterans, was the first to laugh. The rest followed in quick succession.

Kowalski tried to keep a straight face, but even he was rubbing his eyes before too long. “Calvin, look, I know you mean well, and you know you’ve got a lot of respect from all of us, but come on. That’s a fool’s errand.”

Priscilla sneered down at him. “When you can come up with the money, men, and equipment to destabilize the world’s most powerful, secretive, influential agency, you come let us know and we’ll make you King of Shit Mountain. How’s that sound?”

Calvin raised both eyebrows this time and took a deep breath as he flipped further forward in the stack of papers in front of him.

“To this end,” he continued, “I’d like to cite the procedures established in the Summa Modus Operandi.”

Delta fell silent. A few of them looked towards each other, confused. Sylvester Sloan’s eyes suddenly became very sharp. “Is that so?”

“Hang on now,” Dane Blank said, flipping hurriedly through his own papers, “what’s that? I haven’t heard about that.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" That sounds important, is it important?”

Desdemona Vance, the youngest member of the group, pulled a thick, filthy binder from a bag sitting beside her. Cracking it open, she leafed past the introductions to a spot a few pages in, and began reading. “We hold the following to be inescapable truths…”

Calvin held up a hand. “I’ll save you the trouble. This document was written by the first Delta Command at the behest of the Engineer himself. If we take this document at its word, then you don’t need to destroy the Foundation to destroy the Foundation. You just need to destroy the Overseers.”

Priscilla barked out another laugh, one that was not shared with her fellows. “Yes, of course, that will be so much easier. Thirteen immortal demigods that have no doubt long since buried themselves in spells and witchery. How simple.”

But Sylvester Sloan was still watching Calvin very closely. “The Thirteenth Overseer has assured immortality for the others, so long as he sits on the Council. You’d have to find him first… well, you’d have to find all of them at some point, which would be itself impossible, unless you had…” his eyes narrowed, “unless you had the journal.”

Calvin nodded, and reaching into a pocket inside the chest of his jacket, produced a small, blue, leather bound book partially wrapped in brown paper.

“Holy shit,” Kowalski said, “where did you get that?”

Desdemona peered at it quizzically. “What is it?”

“Years ago,” Kowalski said, “we received a report that one of the Coalition’s finest agents, some fellow with a weird codename, had been putting together a report about the Foundation Overseers - where they live, places they frequent, their habits and activities. In other words, if you wanted to find the Overseers, it would be the perfect place to start.”

“I still don’t understand,” Priscilla said, “don’t we keep tabs on the Overseers? We know where they are, don’t we?”

Sylvester scoffed. “No.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" We tell our agents we do, and every now and again we’ll get some report of one of them passing through and somebody getting a glimpse of them. If we really had to, we could probably come up with the real-time locations of maybe half. A few more if we got lucky.” He extended a crooked finger towards the journal. “But those Overseers aren’t why that’s important. It’s important because it supposedly contains the location of two Overseers - including the Thirteenth - who have never been seen before, ever. Until that book was written, nobody was sure if they actually existed.”

Kowalski was furiously rubbing his temples. “Ok, ok. Slow down, let me- let me think.” He looked over the sheaf of papers in his hands again. “Alright, so say you can find them. That’s great, that’s a, uh, that’s a good start. But there’s more to it than that. The contract - they’ve got a contract with Death, and as long as they’ve got the contract they can’t die. That wasn’t true when the Summa Modus Operandi was written, so that’s why it’s always been seen as more of a guideline than a hard and fast protocol, because you can’t kill Death.”

Calvin nodded. “You’re right. You can’t kill Death. I don’t think you have to kill Death, though, you just need to break the contract.”

Sylvester leaned forward, responding now with carefully chosen words. “If you wanted to break the contract, you’d need something that could steal someone back from Death. You’d need… well, you’d need something that hasn’t existed in a hundred years.”

Calvin fished back into his pocket and pulled out a small, glass vial of clear liquid. He set it on the table with a pronounced thunk.

“If you could break the contract, what then?”

Whispers surrounded Calvin. He was suddenly aware of the presence of something great and terrible; something whose furious attention he had immediately gained. In the stillness of the warehouse, behind arcana and beneath the world above, the presence passed through — and then it was gone.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Then, as they had so many times before, Delta dissolved into chaos.

“Holy shit Calvin, how did you-”

“What is that—”

“The Fountain was dry, they emptied—”

“-doesn’t matter, even if he-”

“It knows, It knows, we have said too much already, we-”

“—it would become possible to destroy the Thirteen Foundation Overseers.”

“It would be possible to fulfill the Summa Modus Operandi.”

Kowalski had given up maintaining any kind of order to the stack of papers, and laid them out idly around him. “Where in the world did you come up with that?”

Calvin returned the vial to his pocket. “When we were moving against the Foundation storehouse in Bangladesh, when I was told I was misappropriating Insurgency resources,” he glared at Kowalski out of the corner of his eye, “this is what we were looking for. It wasn’t there, granted, but this-” he held the vial up to eye level, “I found this the same way I found that journal. Luck.”

Sylvester nodded slowly. “If that is what we all here think it is, then I think you’re right, Calvin. I think that would do it.” He stroked the handful of wiry hairs on his chin. “Do they know you have that?”

Calvin hesitated. “No.”

Desdemona leaned forward. “So what’s your plan?”

Calvin slid the journal forward and set the vial next to it. “We find every single one of those rotten bastards, using this-” he pushed a finger down on the journal, “starting with the Thirteenth and working forward. Once they’re in the ground, the Foundation will be without governance and will fall apart. We sweep up the pieces, and with the Overseers removed this world can begin to heal.” He leaned back. “Someday down the line, we all wake up one day in a world no longer under threat of the supernatural. A world free to choose its own destiny.”

Kowalski continued to flip through the papers Calvin had stacked in front of him, more slowly now. He paused on one passage, and then looked up.

“Alright. I’m convinced.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Our resources are limited - if you’d wanted to attempt this like, twenty years ago, we might’ve been in a better spot to help you.” He drummed a finger on the table. “Of course, you didn’t have that journal before now, which is really the game changer here.”

Kowalski turned towards his colleagues. “Any of you in opposition to this? If we do this, we have to do it - there’s no half-assing it. I’ll be the first to admit we’re wildly outmatched, but if what Calvin says is true we’ve at least got surprise on our side, which counts for something.” He nodded. “All in favor?”

They all spoke in unison. “Aye.”

Kowalski turned back to Calvin.

“What do you need?”

NOW

He had asked for three individuals - specialized and experienced agents each. The logic was straightforward enough: the Foundation was a massive, inexorable machine. Moving the means of the Insurgency against it would fail, as it had time and time before. The Insurgency had never quite recovered from being shattered by the Foundation all those years ago, and the squabbling factions and schisms within that group were only barely held together by Delta. Trying to turn that disorder into action would be disastrous.

But a group of four, a group small enough to sneak past the all-seeing eye of the Foundation, might make it work. The Insurgency had resources, enough to create distractions where they were needed and reinforce the team if necessary. But Delta had made it very clear: their reach had limits. If the group passed beyond Delta's ability to support them, they would be on their own.

The first of them was Anthony Wright, a well-seasoned British agent of the Insurgency in his fifties with a kill-list nearly as long as his list of accolades. After Delta came into power, the Insurgency had still only been little more than a handful of groups of beleaguered and chaotic idealists - but throughout their history, Anthony had been a voice of reason and direction.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He had maintained the original goals of the Insurgency and had been looked to for guidance for as long as anyone could remember. Whenever Delta had an opening, it was often thought he would take a seat at the table, but he had always refused the position.

The second was a woman, younger slightly than Calvin but not much. Her name was Olivia Torres, and until a few years prior she had been known within the anomalous community as the famed anartist "Ivory". Her installations were well known, especially in the Three Portlands that she had called home. The Foundation, long believing that she was active within AWCY? circles, had pursued her relentlessly. When they finally closed in, she fled to the Insurgency and had started fresh there.

The last was Adam Ivanov, which caught Delta by surprise. Adam was young, inexperienced, and was not a fighter. He was good with computers - a prodigy, even - but was next to useless with a gun. Calvin, however, was adamant in his decision. He knew about Adam before Adam had known about him, and had made a series of actions over the past several years that led Adam away from the Ukrainian separatist group he had been involved with into the waiting arms of the Insurgency.

Calvin had history with Anthony and Olivia - he had trained with and fought alongside Anthony for the better part of the last decade, and Olivia had been assigned to him on a handful of raids before his exile. Both responded to his request eagerly. Adam, though, was hesitant. He had taken some convincing. Even still, Calvin could sense a desire in his heart. Adam had spent his youth as a Foundation D-Class assigned to SCP-610 by virtue of his parents being Ukrainian political prisoners. A raid on a Foundation labor camp had liberated him from the horrors of his captivity, and Anthony had carried him out of danger himself. When the young man heard that his savior was among those he would serve alongside, he quickly submitted to the request.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Thus it was that a scant three months later, their small ship wrestled against the waves towards a jagged black spear that pierced the stormy waters of the southern Atlantic, looming with silent malevolence. Calvin stood on the ship’s prow as the tower came into view. He could feel the mnestics burning in his mind; he could see the shimmering glow of the tower’s anomalous nature. A scar, he thought.

“What is it?” he heard Olivia say as she took her place beside him. “It’s magic, right? A cognitohazard, maybe?”

“No, not a cognitohazard. It’s an antimeme. The Foundation didn’t build this. Something else did, a long time ago. Whatever they built it for isn’t there anymore, so the Foundation has repurposed it.” He laughed. “How do you escape a prison you don’t even realize you’re in? Or in our case, how do you find something that isn’t on any map? That can’t even be on a map?”

Olivia shrugged. “I was wondering the same thing. How’d you find where this was?”

Calvin produced the small blue journal. “This was the personal journal of someone who had studied the Overseers and their methods for decades." He flipped it over and back. "It sat in a box for years before somebody realized what it was. When Skitter Marshall picked it up, he realized he’d struck gold.”

“So how much did it cost?”

Calvin shrugged. “Nothing. I stole it.”

Olivia nodded and looked back toward the tower. “It’s beautiful, in a way. Otherworldly.”

“It is.”

A wave smashed against the side of the ship, surging up in front of them in a blanket of freezing sea foam. Calvin instinctively reached out to shield her. Olivia stepped back, but gave him a smile.

The muted whine of the foghorn rose up behind them. Calvin turned and hurled himself up the stairs of the wheelhouse. There, Anthony Wright gruffly tugged at the wheel — in-between taking long, hard puffs from the fat stogie that dangled out the side of his mouth.

“This is stupid, Calvin,” Anthony said, furiously chomping on the cigar.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “There’s nowhere to land. I haven’t even been on a ship in sixteen years. This was your plan?”

Calvin squinted at the tower. Their mnestics would only last so long; afterwards, they wouldn’t even be able to perceive the tower. This had to be quick — and the seas were not helping.

“The entrance is above,” Calvin pointed towards an opening in the rocky face. “Think you can get us up there?”

Anthony looked at him like he was mad. “I’ll get something up there. I hope you don’t need the boat afterwards.”

Calvin slapped him on the back and grinned. “There are always more boats.”

Anthony rolled his eyes and spun the wheel, bringing their ship around. “The next swell, we’re going to gun it. Tell them to hold on down there, because the only way we get this done is by wrecking the boat. You get that, right? This’ll wreck the boat.”

Calvin nodded.

“Alright, then. Let’s wreck the boat.”

Calvin scurried down the stairs to find the others. Olivia and Adam were in the hallway; Adam looked ready to vomit. He grabbed them both and pulled them toward the galley, shoving them toward a pillar. “Stay here and hold on!”

He turned to go back up — just as the ship slammed into a massive wave with the force of a thunderclap. The whole vessel lurched down, up, then forward. For one instant, Calvin could feel his guts squeezing up out of his throat, pressing behind his clenched teeth. By the time he reached the top of the stairs, the ship’s hull was screeching. Iron and wood grinded across harsh, merciless stone.

The hull went on to make several undignified creaks and pops, then came to a stop. Calvin stumbled up to the deck; the boat was now fully docked inside the tower’s entrance. Behind them, the ocean continued to rage.

Adam was the first to crawl out behind Calvin, but only so he could heave the contents of his stomach over the rails.

Anthony — who, by some miracle, remained mostly dry — walked down past Adam, unlatched the anchor, and threw it over the side.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" It made a dull, metallic thunk as it slammed into dry rock.

“Land ho,” he announced.

Adam wiped spittle away from his mouth with the back of his sleeve. “Madness. You are mad. This is madness. I can barely… urk… this whole place makes me dizzy.” He tried to stand, stumbling backwards. “You people, you old people, you’re on your way out. I’ve got my whole life ahead of me, and you crash us into the side of a mountain. Very considerate.” He turned back to the railing and heaved again.

Calvin patted Adam on the back. “Patience, Adam. You’ll stay here with Olivia and Anthony. I’ll go alone.” He looked back to Anthony. “Make sure nobody follows me.”

Anthony nodded. “Remember what I told you. Don’t trust a word. They’ll say anything — lie through their teeth. Be careful.”

Calvin reassured the older man with a clap to the shoulder. “I will. I’ll need you — all of you — very soon. But this part… I can handle this alone.”

Calvin leapt over the railing and down to the stone below. The entryway narrowed into a tunnel; he followed the passage into the darkness ahead.

It ended at a freight elevator after forty meters. He could still hear the distant roar of the ocean echoing off the smooth stone walls. In the dim light, Calvin could barely make out deep cuts in the stone — almost like lacerations. He pulled the iron railing open, stepping inside and hitting a button. Just before it started down, it occurred to him that the entrance looked like it had been smashed into the tower — rather than cut.

He could not say how long the descent took. After a few minutes, the smooth metal of the shaft gave way to rock. The elevator’s interior grew cold; he could make out the faint sound of something beating below. Calvin reached into his pocket and touched the vial, reassuring himself that it was still there.

The elevator stopped. The carriage shuddered, and — with a groan — the gate slid open.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He had arrived at a massive chamber lit by torches, each burning with a smokeless emerald flame. The walls were carved with ancient runes that spiraled up into a yawning darkness; the same darkness yawned beneath his feet. Nothing stood between it and him — save the elevator, and a steel, segmented walkway extending out from it.

The walkway reached the center of the chamber. There, a column of stone rose up out of the pit. When Calvin took a step toward it, a pebble glanced off the side of his boot and fell below. He waited to hear it land.

Two minutes later, he stopped waiting.

He crossed the chasm across the walkway. His footfalls were the only sound he heard, save one — the soft beating that came from below. As he drew close to the dais, he could make out its solitary occupant: Seated on a small, plain metal folding chair — bound to it by thin, gold chains — was a human corpse.

Calvin opened his mouth to speak, but was interrupted by a sound. It was like a stale rattle — a horrid, empty noise. It filled the room like a chorus, echoing off the walls. It was laughter. Mocking laughter.

He approached the corpse, examining it. Hollow, rotted sockets were all that remained of its eyes. Despite this, it stared at him with a fierce intensity. He felt the familiar chill again; suddenly, the beating below stopped.

“A visitor.” The corpse’s mouth did not move; nevertheless, a voice creaked out from it like a draft through a tomb. “How peculiar. I don’t often receive guests.”

Calvin hesitated. “You’re O5-13, correct?”

That wretched laugh spilled out again. “In a sense. This body was once that of Dr. Felix Carter; The Meddler. He was the Thirteenth. I reside here, in his place.”

Calvin nodded. “So yes, then. Good - you will commune with me. I have come to renegotiate your contract.”

Something flashed across his vision. He saw endless fields of corpses; fire and blood. He saw a parade of red horrors, — and a silent figure watching from above.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Calvin shook his head and looked away. When he turned back, it almost looked like the corpse was smiling.

“You have no authority here, Calvin Lucien.” Calvin stepped back in shock. “Yes, I know your name. Yours is not one of the thirteen penned on the contract. Your hand cannot break it.”

Calvin collected his nerve. “You’re right. It’s not. But humor me, if you would. Your contract — what are its terms? What were you promised?”

Somewhere inside the corpse, something growled. “Fine. No harm in humoring the soon-to-be-dead. The contract offered an escape for the Thirteen from the hand of fate. Life everlasting.”

“They already had the Fountain of Youth. Why did they need you?”

“The Fountain had run dry. Even then, it could not save them from me, only keep me at arms length. When they began to die, the First came to me to bargain. I offered to stay my hand — in exchange for a seat at the table.” The rotted voice laughed again. “It was a simple negotiation.”

Calvin walked behind the corpse. His eyes traced the sigils along the walls that surrounded them. “And as part of the contract, they gave you this man? Gave you his life?”

“No. His life was insured, as part of the contract. They gave me his body. He lingers on the edge of death eternally; his mind is given to the sublime ecstasy of near-death.”

Calvin cocked his head sideways. “He’s not dead?”

The corpse scoffed. “No.”

Calvin pulled the vial from his pocket and pulled out the cork.

“Good. Drink up, you crusty old bitch.”

He reached out from behind the corpse, seizing it by the chin; with just a squeeze, he forced its mouth open. With the other hand, he emptied the contents of the vial into the pit of its throat — taking care to ensure not a drop was wasted. When the vial was empty, he released its face and stepped in front of it.

“What was that?” its voice hissed. “Where did you get that? How did-”

The change was immediate. Color rushed back into the corpse’s face; blood surged through its body.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Fresh pink tissue filled the gaps where its skin had flaked away. Glistening knobs of white swelled up into its sockets. The emaciated torso spasmed, then expanded; the corpse lurched upward as it took in a gasping, choked breath. A violent, painful coughing spasm forced ages of collected dust to evacuate its lungs. Its arms lunged down to grab its chair.

In a span of only a minute, the corpse had become a nude man. The convulsions began to settle. His eyes — hazel-gold and now filled with fear — darted back and forth.

“What have you done?” he shrieked, his voice hoarse from disuse. “What have you done?!”

Something dark and silver began to seep out of the man’s eyes, nose, and mouth. It was like smoke, but thicker. It shimmered in the air above him like a cloud. His eyes rolled back toward the shape; he cried out like a panicked animal.

“No! Don’t leave me! Don’t leave me! Don’t-”

Calvin leveled his gun at the man and squeezed the trigger. He buried one slug in his temple, then another in his heart.

Dr. Felix Carter jerked away with a final gasp. His body slumped into the chair; his head fell back. He stared into the darkness above.

Calvin grabbed the back of the metal folding chair and dragged it to the edge of the dias. With a firm shove of his foot, he pushed the chair — along with its occupant — into the pit below. There was a brief clatter of chains; then, nothing.

Calvin felt the presence again. When he turned, he found a silver woman draped in darkness standing alongside him. She peered into the abyss. Her eyes looked sad.

“The living body of the Thirteenth,” she said. “The contract is invalid. I am released from my obligation.”

Calvin swallowed and nodded. “Should fatal peril come to them, you will no longer stay your hand against the other twelve?”

“I will not.” She did not look away from the pit. “They are free to die.”

Calvin sighed. “Good. That is enough.” He turned back to the elevator, taking a step. Something made him pause.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He looked back to the pale figure, struggling with the question he wanted to ask.

“Why didn’t you stop me? You have the authority and power to do so. Why did you stand by and do nothing?”

At last, she turned and regarded him. Calvin felt an overwhelming swell of solitude — of melancholy — rush through him. “Something festers at the heart of the council. Something that will not die. I thought that, perhaps, if I had a seat at their table, I could find it, make it die. But I couldn’t. There are things in this world beyond even my reach, Calvin Lucien.”

She turned back to the pit. “Perhaps you will fare better. Perhaps not.”

— - —

Delta Command sent another ship to fetch them. Shortly after they boarded, Calvin was approached by Desdemona, who handed him a briefing.

“Did you have any trouble?” she asked.

Calvin shook his head. “Getting here. Getting in.” He looked back to where the tower had been. “I can’t even see it anymore. Like it was never there, and yet…” He reached into his pocket, pulling out the journal. “This guy knew about it a decade ago.”

The young woman laughed. “Yes. Well, I’m sure your mystery agent had his own way with things. Just like we need you to have yours. All of our plans are in motion now, Calvin. They all rest on you performing your duty.” She nodded in the direction of the absent tower. “With any luck, the rest of them will be as simple as this.”

Calvin laughed and shook his head. "That's unlikely. We got a good first lick in while they weren't looking, but there won't be any surprise next time."

In a room devoid of light or sound, a man sat at his desk and read. There was a time when the darkness would have impeded him — but that time had passed. Now, he found it comforting. Colors distracted him from his work.

He turned to the next page of the report — despite not needing to ‘see’ the words to read them. Old habits, he supposed. With each successive sentence, his calm gave way to cold, calculated purpose.

The door opened. A blade of light pierced the room, illuminating the man and his desk. It cut across his forearm and highlighted an old burn scar. He instinctively moved his hand out to cover it.

He looked up. A woman stood at the doorway, hesitating. It was only then that he realized his face was twisted with rage.

He forced himself to relax, acknowledged her with a nod, and motioned her in.

She took two steps forward and spoke: “You’ve heard?”

“Yes.” He closed the report. “Do we know who yet?”

“Not yet.” She moved to approach, but stopped — as if a wind forced her back. “Whoever found the Pinnacle did so with the use of mnestics, and there’s a limited supply. We’re looking.”

“And the Contract?”

The woman didn’t respond.

He sighed. “Felix?”

“We didn’t find him.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" If he fell, or was pushed, he might still be falling. We have to assume the worst.”

The man stood, his eyes fixed on the backs of his own knuckles. “I don’t understand how this could happen. I don’t understand who would do this. Who could do this. Do they even know what they did?” He looked up at her. “This is bad.”

Her expression did not change. “The rest of the council has been alerted. I just came here to make sure you knew.” She took another step forward; her hand fell to his desk. “Maybe… maybe if we just-”

“Whatever you were about to say, don’t.” His voice was flat; something trembled just under the surface. “Whoever they are, they got lucky.”

She frowned. He could see the weariness in her face. There was something she wanted to tell him; there was something she wanted to say. Instead, she just closed her eyes and nodded.

He reached for her hand upon the desk, taking it into his own. His palm was like worn, scraped leather. Hers was ice. “I know you’re tired. I know. God, I know. I’m…”

He forced himself to stop. He took a breath, turned her hand over, and traced the scars along her wrist and forearm. She looked so frail, now. “We can’t stop now. We can’t give up now.”

Her eyes were still closed. “I know.”

“Go, now. Go back to the Garden. You know the way in. You’ll be safe there. I'm going to call up the task forces and we’ll figure out what this is. I’ll call you when it’s clear.”

She squeezed his hand back. At last, her eyes opened. “What about you?”

He smiled. “ I just need to figure some things out, and then I’ll come for you.”

He came around the desk and held her; she held him back. After a few moments of silence, she turned her head up to his. “I—”

The phone rang.

He grimaced. His grip on her loosened. “I’m sorry. I…”

Her expression hardened. She released him, nodding. “I know.” Without another word, she turned and left him alone.

He reached for the phone.

“The Accountant.” Anthony found the title amusing.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “Do they only have one?”

Olivia laughed. “That’s a lot of math. He must be some sort of uber-nerd.”

“A dire nerd,” Adam offered, his eyes never leaving the screen of his laptop.

This comment drew blank stares from Olivia, Anthony, and Calvin.

“You know, like a dire wolf? From D&D? Or Game of Thrones? Or…” Adam looked up. He immediately scowled, then went right back to typing. “Fuck, you people are old.”

Anthony took a drag of his cigarette and eyed Calvin from across the room. “Alright. So, how are you planning on finding all these fucks? I doubt they’re just hanging out at the local pub. They’re probably holed up somewhere with enough anomalous ordinance to make Mordor look like the Shire.” He gave Adam a look, who — without raising his head — lifted two fingers in appreciation.

Calvin nodded. “Yeah. This is where it gets tricky. Our mystery agent wrote a lot about the Overseers, and a little bit about where they live, or where they’d be hiding, but a lot of it is situational and might not be helpful. That’s why we’re going after the Accountant first. He’s the one who pays the rent. Take him out, and the list of possible safe-houses gets that much smaller. ”

Olivia leaned back in her chair. “Perfect. We just need to find this first one, then. The first one of these gods-on-Earth that know we’re coming for them. Do you even have a plan?”

Calvin gestured to his right. “I’ve got Adam.”

Adam leaned away from his computer. “Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah, I can find him.”

Anthony snorted. “This’ll be good.”

Adam ignored him: “The Accountant is, as far as we can tell, a mathematical prodigy who specializes in statistical analysis. He’s a data-sponge — he soaks up information, analyzes it, and finds hidden correlations no one else can see. Everything he does, he does based on these invisible relationships. His entire route — what he wears, what he drinks, his day-to-day activities — they’re all based on predictions derived from these correlations.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

He turned his screen around to show the others. Several tabs were open in his browser; the current one was a graph of current stock prices. “Now, I probably don’t need to tell you what a person like this could do in stock markets. He analyzes data faster than computers; he can predict the boom and bust of a Fortune 500 based on a goddamn train schedule. And although his ability to see these correlations is anomalous, the correlations themselves aren’t — they’re just impossible for anyone else to understand or decode.”

“Alright,” Anthony said. “But that doesn’t tell us how to—”

“Train schedules,” Olivia cut him off. She was focused on one of the unopened tabs on the screen. “In Tokyo?”

Adam grinned and nodded. He opened the tab, revealing a translated train schedule. “The journal mentioned it. I’ve been having Alexander crunching numbers for a few weeks—”

“Alexander?” Anthony narrowed his eyes.

“It’s the name he gave his laptop,” Calvin replied. “What did you find?”

“Basically, there’s some sort of weird correlation between international housing markets and train schedules printed in Tokyo on the fifth day of every third month,” Adam said. “And based on how deliberate this guy is, I’d be willing to bet money he goes to Tokyo himself to examine those schedules the day they’re printed.”

“Hang on.” Olivia leaned in to examine the screen closer. “You said this guy is able to make predictions based on correlations no one else can see, right? Wouldn’t that lead him to realize he shouldn’t be where we expect him to be?”

Adam cocked his head. “Are you asking me if he can see into the future?”

“Well, yeah. Isn’t that basically what this is?” Olivia turned from the screen and focused her attention on Adam. “If he’s able to magically see connections no one else can, isn’t it possible some piece of information he’s encountered will tell him that we’re coming? Or even who we are?”

“I don’t think so,” Calvin said. “I mean, the numbers can be wrong.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

Adam shook his head. “No, she’s — well, mostly right. The numbers can’t be wrong. They’re just data. He can’t know anything for sure, though. He just makes predictions, and those predictions have varying degrees of certainty. That’s the hiccup, here: He can know there’s a 75% chance that today, someone will attack him. He can know there’s a 30% chance it’ll be five people, a 25% chance it’ll be four people, a 20% chance it’ll be three people… so on.”

Anthony massaged his brows. “Look, do we really need to take a probabilities course to kill this guy? I get that he’s smart, but last time I checked, train schedules don’t stop bullets.”

“But bullets won’t stop someone who isn’t even there,” Olivia replied. She turned back to Adam. “So, basically, he can predict extremely complex systems based on seemingly random bits of data. Right?”

Adam nodded. “Right.”

Olivia gave them all a very crooked grin. “In that case, I think I know exactly how to beat him.”

The black car pulled to the side of a street in the Tokyo financial district. The man who stepped out was so extraordinarily unremarkable that, under normal circumstances, even his lack of remarkability failed to generate a remark.

His high end tailored suit and dark glasses blended with the well-to-dos of the region; his skin was a shade of amber-gold. Despite being aware of the time, he checked his wristwatch, closed the car door, then took three steps down the sidewalk. The vehicle drove away.

The Accountant was a man of precision. He slept for exactly seven hours; when he woke, it was on the hour. Each footfall was calculated — each step predetermined. He made no mistakes, took no chances, and accounted for every significant possibility.

That’s why, when he first noticed the young man approaching him from across the street, he took immediate action. The man was in his 20s; short hair, open coat — Slavic, if he had to wager a guess.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Based on the color of the man’s shoes, the Accountant determined he was here to kill him. Based on the current market price of peaches, the Accountant determined he was not alone.

He took a step to the left. A crowd of businessmen had just emerged from a nearby diner; this put at least fifteen people between him and the would-be assassin. One of the fifteen was Japanese — in his mid-50s. He walked with a slight limp and was going bald. This meant the second assassin was in the third story window of the small wine-shop across the street.

The Accountant adjusted his watch, reflecting sunlight off its surface and into the window. The sniper was briefly blinded. Now that neither assassin could see him, he moved to enter a nearby office building.

“Fuck. Glare,” Anthony growled into his mic. “You see him?”

Adam fought his way through the crowd, shaking his head. “No. Lost him. He’s anticipating everything we’re doing. I think — he’s gotta be in that building with the blue glass. Heading for it.”

Olivia peeked out from around the corner and touched her ear-piece. “Calvin, should I go in with him?”

There was a brief pause before Calvin replied: “Yes.”

Olivia jogged toward the financial office. Adam pushed his way through several more people to follow her.

The interior was a sprawling three-story lobby framed with marble. A grand staircase extended up to each level, with glass elevators providing an alternate route. Adam’s eyes darted between the various levels.

“Which level?” Adam asked.

She yanked Adam by the arm and pulled. “Neither. This way.”

The two of them took off toward the far-end of the building. An emergency exit led to an alleyway out back. Olivia shoved the door open and stepped through; Adam followed. As soon as they stepped outside, they were greeted with the sound of muffled gunfire.

“Shit!” Olivia shoved Adam between two dumpsters; she soon followed him, dropping to a crouch.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" She flipped out her compact mirror and held it out, using the reflection to search the alley ahead.

Two men in suits stood where the alley emptied out into the street. Between them, the Accountant checked his watch.

“Hm. This will work,” he announced. “We’ve got about a minute before I leave to catch my train. So, what can I do for you?”

Olivia examined the reflection in her mirror. Adam squinted at the image, frowning. “He’s just standing out in the open,” he whispered. “We could just—”

She reached to touch her ear-piece again. “Calvin. Do we go for it?”

Calvin’s reply came almost immediately: “No.”

Olivia looked to Adam. “Keep him talking.”

Adam nodded. He turned to the side of the dumpster and hollered: “You’re the Accountant, right?”

“You know, I do have a professional title. And a name, if you’d rather—”

“We know who you are,” Adam yelled back. “We’re here to kill you.”

“Yes, I’m aware. Well, here I am. Go ahead. Take a shot.”

Olivia gestured for Adam to keep going.

“Uh-huh. But do you know why we’re here to kill you?”

“Twenty nine seconds. You’re very likely the ones I received word about, just this morning. You’re responsible for terminating our contract with Death. I presume you want to murder me over some sort of ideological quibble.”

“An ideological quibble?” Adam’s voice nearly hitched up an octave. Olivia reached to touch his shoulder. “You know how many corpses your organization is built on top of? How many people die every day just so you fucks get to run the show?”

“I’ve never killed anyone. Of course, I’m certain you’ve killed a few. How many? A dozen? A hundred? Did you bother to learn any of their names?” the Accountant asked. He checked his watch again. “Were any of them children? Just curious.”

Adam jerked against Olivia’s grip. She squeezed him, hard. “Don’t,” she whispered. “He’s trying to get a rise out of you.”

“Fuck him,” Adam growled. His grip on his pistol was tight enough to force the blood out of his knuckles.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “Like he hasn’t killed—”

“Well, if you’re not going to try and murder me, I suppose I’ll just have to leave early,” the Accountant said. Again, he looked at his watch. “Seven seconds.”

“We’re going to miss our chance,” Adam hissed. “I’m going to—”

“No, Calvin said—”

Adam was already lunging to his feet — and Olivia was lunging to tackle him. Her arms slammed into his legs, forcing him to buckle. In the next instant, a deafening pop rushed out to fill the alleyway. A fist-sized crater appeared in the dumpster behind them — right where Adam’s head had been.

Wisps of smoke swirled up from the hole. Adam and Olivia both stared at it, their backs pressed against the other dumpster.

“Shit,” Adam whispered.

“Sniper,” Olivia replied.

“One,” the Accountant announced. “Everyone down.”

Several more pops echoed out through the street — accompanied by distant screams. Olivia and Adam caught the sound of glass shattering; the popping sounds were followed by additional gunfire.

Anthony’s voice boomed over the earpiece: “I’m covering you. Go.”

Olivia and Adam ran for the door. In the distance, they could hear the sirens — along with the squealing rubber of the Accountant’s car as it drove away.

— - —

Sometimes, the Accountant wondered what it was like to live in uncertainty; to exist in a world where you could not predict the most likely outcome based on the data in front of you. He imagined it was a dreadful, unbearable state — like being trapped in a nightmare where nothing made any sense. The thought often prompted a feeling of tremendous pity.

He felt no pity at this moment.

As he approached the boarding station, he checked his watch and revisited the alleyway in his mind. He had replayed the events that unfolded there twenty three times; each time, none of it made sense. None of it fit the model.

He correctly predicted the arrival of the two assassins; he also correctly predicted the arrival of their comrade.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" But his models had shown that, by standing out in the open and addressing them, there was an overwhelming likelihood that at least one would emerge and be immediately struck down by his stationed sniper.

Nothing was truly certain, he knew. Every rule had its exception; every absolute hid a sliver of doubt. Everything he understood was merely an approximation of something he did not.

But the chance of both assassins emerging from this conflict unscathed were, by his calculations, comparable in magnitude to a tornado arranging a deck into a house of cards — then back into the same ordered deck. It was beyond ‘unlikely’; it was nothing short of miraculous.

Was that what he had witnessed? A miracle of probability? An event as rare and near-impossible as the emergence of life itself?

He stepped on-board the train, providing his ticket. He moved to one of the private rooms, sliding the door aside and taking his seat. As the city began to slip past, he ran through the model for the twenty fourth time, then decided that he would simply need to let it go.

The sliding door rattled open. A not-quite middle-aged man with dark, faintly greying hair stepped in, taking the opposite seat. He casually reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a revolver, aiming it squarely at the Accountant’s heart.

The Accountant stared, uncomprehending. This wasn’t possible. This couldn’t be possible.

Two miracles? In one day?

“How?” he croaked.

Calvin reached into his pocket with his other hand, withdrawing a small, unremarkable coin. He perched it on top of his thumb and proceeded to flip it, before snatching it out of the air. He then showed it to the Accountant.

Tails.

The gears in his head started to turn. “You…”

“You’re good at predicting complicated systems," Calvin said, "but only when they behave the way they’re supposed to. You can’t predict them if all their decisions are inherently unpredictable.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

“But how did you know I would be—”

“We overheard you say you had a train to catch. There were two train stations nearby. So I flipped a coin.”

The Accountant closed his eyes and smiled. “How utterly boorish. You got lucky.”

“Yeah. But it worked, didn’t it?”

“So it did.” His eyes opened; he focused his gaze on Calvin. "Well. Now you've got me here. What do you want?"

Calvin laid a piece of paper in front of him and pulled out a pen. He slid them across the table between them towards The Accountant.

"Names," he said. "Locations. All of the rest of them."

The Accountant sighed. "You want me to give up the names and locations of the other Overseers? What — do you want their PIN numbers, too?"

Calvin tapped the revolver on the table. "This probably isn't the time to get smart."

The Accountant sat back in his chair and loosened his tie. "I'm not going to do that. You used a funny trick to put me in a compromising position, and that's clever. But now that we're here, I know exactly how this plays out. Why would I compromise my associates when you're just going to kill me either way?"

Calvin shrugged. "There's a difference between being shot and being dragged behind this train."

The other man swallowed. "That's barbaric — and either way, it's not particularly likely. We're not too far from our destination, and there will be too many people around. The way I die is at the end of that gun."

"That doesn't bother you?"

The Accountant rolled his tongue across his teeth. "Of course it does. I haven't thought about the idea of dying in such a long time, and to now be sitting here looking at it, it's nothing short of horrifying. But I'm not going to beg for mercy from a terrorist." He leaned forward. "Do you truly understand what it is you're doing?”

Calvin didn't answer. The Overseer sighed.

"Go ahead. We both know what you're going to do next."

Calvin squeezed the trigger.

## THE GRAND ILLUSION

THEN

“This,” the man at the front of the room said, revealing a slide covered in many colored dots, “is the Universe. Everything that ever has been or- or will ever be that we can reach is on this slide. So far as we know, this is it; the entire sum of existence.”

He turned off the projector, and for a moment the room was dark. When the light came back on, the image was a painting of the Earth, as if taken from above and far away.

“This is us, obviously,” the man said, centering the slide. “Nearly every living thing that we’re aware of has been born and died on this rock.” He paused for effect. “Not such bad real estate, really.”

He adjusted the slide again as the audience attempted meager laughter.

“And this… is an atom. Or at least, uh, a representation of one. Technology hasn’t caught up yet to where we can see these little guys, but we’ve got a pretty good idea about what they might look like. Now, the atom is a- a building block, the very most basic particle in the Universe. Or rather, it might be. There may be particles even smaller than that, and smaller particles that compose those.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" It’s difficult to say where this ends, but at the bottom of this has to be something fundamental… right? Something that doesn’t just comprise the other building blocks, but necessitates their being. That’s what we were searching for.”

The lights came back up, and the man turned around. His white jacket bore the name “Felix Carter Ph.D.” in blue lettering. His round glasses sat perched atop a red nose, and his grey hair was combed neatly to the side.

“When we approached the uh, the International Academy of Existential Sciences, we came with a single goal; discover the reason why. We weren’t asked to provide an explanation, o-or deduce why the uh, reason why; our task was to find the part of the universe that determines why we are what we are. Today, I’m happy to announce we have done this.”

He extended his arm, and another man came into view. This man was tall, with cropped brown hair and a black jacket. He smiled and waved politely at the enthusiastic applause and stood with his hands clasped in front of him as he was introduced.

“This is Dr. Frederick Williams, of the Royal Scientific Conservatory. It was with his assistance and financial backing that we uh, that we made this breakthrough discovery.”

The two of them paused as the lights dimmed again, and the projector above produced an image. The image was faint, and full of static, but its focal point was clear: a single white line extending across the image, fading at both ends.

“What you’re looking at here is a thread,” Dr. Carter continued. “We’ve only just started calling them that; we had no idea what they would look like when we started. We were able to get this thread to manifest itself using a series of high energy pulses directed at a tiny piece of Ozymandium film. This method was borrowed from Dr.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Adam Bright and his team in the United States, who have been working on a similar project in the hopes of eliciting what they’re calling tachyons, the uh, the fundamental building block of time, as it were. We discovered that, by tuning our equipment just so, we were able to make something that shouldn’t happen… happen.”

The image changed. On the next slide, a nearby structure is seen being pulled dramatically towards the center of the thread. On the next, the thread is gone, and the building is crumpled and misshapen.

“This was what we witnessed. By causing one of these threads to appear for just an instant, one of these elements of the foundation of the universe, and then manipulating it ever so slightly, we increased gravity in the region by nearly seven-thousand percent in an instant. I will say that again: we have manipulated the physical laws of the universe using a bright light and a rock.”

The assembled audience applauded again. After a moment, Dr. Carter held up a hand for quiet.

“The full manifest of our uh, our research will be available shortly, as soon as our sister projects have finished their studies. In three months’ time, we’ll present our findings in full to this assembly, and… and take our first step towards a more knowledgeable future!”

— - —

In the lobby of the auditorium afterwards, Dr. Williams stood speaking to a group of researchers alongside Dr. Carter and his team. Two men approached him, and one of them stuck out his hand.

“Dr. Williams,” the man said, “absolutely a pleasure to meet you. Vincent Arians, Oxford. I’ve been fascinated with your work, truly.”

The taller man smiled. “Mr. Arians, of course. Always nice to meet a fellow alumni.” He looked towards the second of the two. “And your friend?”

“Aaron Siegel,” the man said, following Arians’ handshake with one of his own. “Cornell.”

Dr. Williams’ eyes grew slightly wider. “The renowned physicist. I dare say I half expected you to make this discovery before we did, Dr.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Siegel.”

Aaron smiled. “Unfortunately, our work as of late has taken a different turn. If we were going to solve atomics, we should have done what you did and figured out the geometry first. Your results have been very impressive.”

Dr. Williams’ eyes were pensive. “Yes, Dr. Carter has done some exceptional work. It’s a shame he’s going to be discredited, he really has put so much into this project.”

Arians did a double take. “Wait, he- what?”

Before either of them could say anything else they were approached by a dark-eyed woman, slight, with short black hair and a blue dress with long black gloves. She came up behind Dr. Williams and put a hand on his shoulder and whispered in his ears. He nodded.

“Gentlemen, I’m afraid I am being called away.” He stopped mid turn. “Oh, please, forgive me. Mr. Arians, Dr. Siegel, this is Dr. Sophia Light. She’s been working closely with Dr. Carter and the rest of our team here in London.”

The woman smiled softly and nodded. “Charmed, I’m sure.”

Aaron nodded back while Arians continued to process what he had just heard. Williams fiddled with his pocket for a moment, and then produced a white card with a three-arrowed emblem on it.

“This is my card, Dr. Siegel,” he said. “Have your office call this number here while you’re still in the city and we’ll arrange a proper meeting. Mr. Arians, you are certainly welcome to join as well. Our organization is on the very precipice of some truly inspiring work, and we’re looking for the brightest minds to lead us.” He shrugged. “Something to think about. Until later, gentlemen.”

Dr. Williams donned his cap and coat, and followed Dr. Light out of the parlor.

NOW

“Once upon a time, a man awoke to find he had no memory of who he was or how he had gotten here.”

Olivia snuck out to the studio’s balcony and plucked the pale, slim cigarette out from behind her ear. She was fishing in her pocket for a lighter when she heard the door behind her slide open.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

“Y’know, those things’ll kill you.” Anthony Wright did not look like the sort of man who was accustomed to a suit and tie. He wore them as if they were prison fatigues. “I should know,” he added, showing her a half-empty pack of gum.

“Anthony!” Olivia’s slim figure slipped up against him with the grace of a small, elegant knife. She wrapped her arms around him and hugged him tight. Despite having kicked the habit five years ago, the old man still managed to smell like tobacco.

Anthony dropped an enormous arm around her and gave her a comforting pat. They ended up leaning against the banister, side-by-side. It wasn’t quite morning, yet; below them, the city streets were cast in a tangerine glow. A cool, lethargic breeze drifted past them, carrying the ocean's scent.

“I’m glad you made it,” Olivia told him. She finally pulled out her lighter. It was a cheap hunk of neon green plastic she had picked up on the way to the exhibition. After a few swipes of her thumb, it only managed to spit out sparks.

“Here.” Anthony plucked the lighter out of her hand as if he was taking away a dangerous toy. He produced his own; it was an old, tarnished thing made of brass. It had more dents in it than he did. “And I wouldn’t miss this for the world, lady. Even if it is Seattle.”

Olivia rolled her eyes. Anthony's lighter produced a flame on the first flick; she dipped her head down to bring her cigarette to the fire’s tip. “Spare me. I know you think this is all artsy fartsy crap.”

“Well, alright, can’t say I ‘get’ the Madonna made out of cottage cheese.”

Olivia gave him a look. “You don’t like it?”

Anthony did a brief double-take. “Wait, that one’s — yours? I mean, uh…”

She grinned. “No. I’m kidding. That one’s shit; the guy who made it is a hack.” She turned back to the city, taking a long drag. When she exhaled, wisps of smoke whirled up from her nostrils and licked at the bottom of the balcony overhead. “How’s Calvin?”

“Doing good.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He told me to tell you he’s sorry he couldn’t come, but—”

“Busy. I know. Fuck, I know.” Olivia closed her eyes. “There’s just so much going on, now.”

“Yeah. I don’t think any of us really expected…” Anthony's voice trailed off. “They needed the Accountant more than we realized. Once they lost him, they lost all their funding — everything just started unraveling. Personnel started panicking, sites started collapsing — fuck, two Overseers ended up dead that night.”

Something tugged at the back of Olivia’s mind; something she was forgetting. “How many sites are left, now?”

“Still about two hundred. We decommissioned Site-173 last week. Nothing in it but corpses and cockroaches.” He shook his head. “Just ordinary cockroaches.”

Olivia turned to him. For the first time in a long while, he looked old — old and tired. The wrinkles in his face were carved deep into his skin; his eyes were surrounded by dark, impenetrable circles.

She felt that tug again. “How are you holding up?”

“It’s funny,” Anthony told her, still watching the city. “You spend your life fighting demons, putting out fires — thinking this is the hard part. This is the work that needs doing. This is the work that’ll kill you. But it’s not.” His eyes met hers. “Sweeping up the ashes — putting shit back together again. That’s the hard part.”

She frowned. The tugging was harder, now.

“Don’t get me wrong. Things’re better, now.” He gave her a weary smile. “We don’t have to hurt people. We don’t have to kill people. We don’t have to mutilate children to hold back the nightmares.” His eyes drifted back to the city.

Olivia closed her eyes. “Anthony…”

“I don’t know how the hell we did it, but we won. The world’s… it’s still fucked up. When I go to sleep, I still have nightmares, y’know? But every night, it gets a little better. The nightmares are losing.”

She reached into her pocket and searched for something, pulling it free.

“Anyway, fuck — sorry, I’m just ranting. Listen, Olivia.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask y—”

Olivia slammed all 4 inches of the sleek, razor-sharp crafting knife into Anthony Wright’s heart. For one instant, the old man’s eyes were filled with raw confusion and shock. Then — stumbling back, numbly clutching at the hilt — his eyes were filled with nothing at all.

“I’m sorry,” Olivia whispered. She pushed him over the banister’s edge.

And the world ended.

“Suddenly, a voice spoke to the man: ‘Your second wish has been granted. Now, for your third — and final — wish.’”

“-up. C’mon, c’mon, wake the hell up-”

Slivers of light squeezed through Olivia’s eyelids. She felt a constant buzzing in her ears.

Someone was tugging at her arms.

“Wake up, wake up—”

She popped her eyes open and immediately regretted it. Sharp, jagged sunbeams rushed into her pupils, forcing her to squint. Olivia squeezed one fist into her left socket and started rubbing away. “What… where am I?”

The man stopped shaking her and slumped down into a chair. “Fuck. Thank God.”

Olivia kept rubbing at her eye, letting her vision adjust. She was laying back on a bed inside of a cheap motel room. The overpowered AC rumbled to her left; above it, sunlight streamed in past the curtains. The room smelled faintly of coconut oil.

Adam was seated beside the bed. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. His laptop was sitting on the nightstand, with a pistol laid out next to it.

Olivia blinked her way through the grogginess. “Adam? What’s—”

“How much do you remember?”

Olivia squeezed her eyebrows together; they grinded like cogs in some enormous adding machine. She tried to think her way through the events that had led her here. The last thing she remembered was…

“I was having some sort of dream. Anthony was there, but it was — years from now. It was all wrong. Not real. It felt real, but…”

Adam nodded. “Something was off, right?”

“Yeah.” Olivia closed her eyes and coaxed the dream out from its hiding place in her subconscious.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “He wasn’t smoking, but he had a lighter. We were in Seattle, but we could smell the ocean. And the more I thought about it…”

“The more you realized it was a lie.”

She nodded and opened her eyes. Adam was focused on his laptop.

“I don’t know how, but somehow I realized the only way out of it was to—”

“Yeah.” Adam cut her off. He was taking great pains to not make eye-contact with her. “I know.”

Olivia frowned, sitting up on the bed. “Adam? Do you… uh, want to talk about—”

“It’s fine. We’re out of it, now.” He was pulling a file up on the computer. “You don’t remember how we got here, right?”

Olivia shook her head. “No.”

“Same here. Luckily, I think we planned for this.” He double-clicked something. The laptop’s screen was filled with a still-image of Calvin’s face. His stoic expression stared out at them; behind him, they could see what looked like an office. “Calvin loaded a video on Alexandra, along with instructions to play it if we found ourselves, uh… not remembering anything about how we got here.”

Olivia scooted forward to sit on the edge of the bed beside Adam. He clicked ‘Play’.

A window popped up over the video, requesting two passwords. Over one was the name ‘ADAM’; over the other was the name ‘OLIVIA’.

“It’s encrypted?” Olivia asked. She frowned, staring at the screen.

“I guess. I don’t remember… I mean, there’s a password I might have used,” Adam said, typing something under his name. As soon as he hit enter, his name turned green. He glanced back to her.

Olivia bit down on her bottom lip, thinking.

“Olivia?”

Something tugged at the back of her mind.

Without stopping to think, she snatched Adam’s pistol off the nightstand and buried three rounds directly into his skull.

And then the world ended.

NOW

“The man considered this for a moment, and — seeing no other choice — made his final wish: ‘Allow me to remember all that I have forgotten.’”

“Olivia?”

Olivia opened her eyes.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" She was laid back on a cot inside of a small, comfortable looking office. There was a bookcase stuffed full of leather-bound volumes; in front of it, there was a wide, polished desk.

Calvin was standing over her. He looked distant — when didn’t he? — but his expression carried a hint of concern.

Olivia immediately slammed her knee up into his solar plexus.

Calvin buckled, crouching forward. She rolled off the cot and stumbled toward the desk, fumbling for the hidden latch under one of the drawers. Olivia had been in this office a hundred times before; if memory served, there was a hidden space right… here.

By the time Calvin had managed to catch his breath, Olivia was pointing the pistol straight for his heart.

Calvin raised his hands up and took a step back. “Olivia…”

“Shut up.” She narrowed her eyes. “Let me think.”

Calvin said nothing.

“Someone’s fucking with my head. I’ve gone through two iterations, now. One with Anthony, one with Adam. Each time, they were trying to get information from me,” she said, talking her way through it. “Each time, I realized there was something wrong. A detail out of place. Anthony's lighter. Adam’s computer — he calls it ‘Alexander’, not ‘Alexandra’. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized…”

Calvin started to lower his hands. “Olivia, listen—”

“I said shut up,” she snapped back. “Alright. Each time, it all started unraveling once I realized something was wrong. Each time, I realized the only way to escape was to…” Her breathing quickened.

Calvin took another step back.

“I have to kill you,” she whispered.

“Olivia. Just, okay, just take it easy. Let’s talk this through, alright?”

“I have thought this through. Anthony, Adam, now you — you’re just another dream. Another…” She pursed her lips. “Lie. The Liar. You’re the fucking Liar.”

“Olivia.” Calvin’s tone took on a building urgency. “Please, listen to me. You might be right. Someone might be messing with your head. But it’s not me. I’m not the Liar.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

“Then how the fuck…” Her finger curled tighter around the trigger.

“Listen. Just listen, okay? You were helping me with research. You fell asleep in my office. Now you wake up, and you’ve pulled a gun on me.“ Calvin kept his arms held high. “You said these things unraveled when you noticed something wrong. Have you…?”

Olivia scowled. “Not yet. But…” Her eyes traced their way through the office. It all looked like it was supposed to; unlike the previous two dreams, this was all familiar to her. But did that mean…?

“You said it started with a dream about Anthony, then Adam. Think about it: If I were the Liar, would I really start with Calvin, next?”

Olivia’s breathing slowed. Nothing was out of place; nothing felt off…

“Once is happenstance. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is a pattern,” Calvin told her. “I think the Liar is trying to trick you into killing me.”

Her grip on the trigger loosened.

“You said he was trying to get information from you. What kind of information?”

“I… with Anthony, I don’t know. He said he needed to ask me something. With Adam, it was a password, I think, but…”

“A password?”

Olivia lowered the pistol, but kept a firm grip. “Yeah.” She forced herself to breathe slowly. “Okay. Okay. Just… give me a second, okay?”

Calvin slowly lowered his hands, but kept his distance. “Alright. But yeah, this doesn’t make any sense. You don’t know any passwords that the Liar would want. He didn’t ask you about anything else?” He paused, then added: “He didn’t ask about your copy of the journal, right? You still have it?”

Olivia shook her head. “No, he didn’t — yeah. I still have it.” She reached with her free hand to touch the base of her wrist; the faint, familiar lump was still present. “The journal is right here.”

The Liar smiled. “So it is.”

And then the world ended.

Olivia’s mouth felt like it was coated in a thin layer of dissolving chalk. It left the faint flavor of peppermint lingering on her tongue.

She forced her eyes open, then immediately closed them. Bright, glaring lights beamed straight down into her retina — the throbbing pressure behind her temple intensified.

She was in a hospital room somewhere. Olivia didn’t even need to look around to know that; she could just feel it. She hated hospitals. Counting backwards from ten, she eased her eyes open and gave them time to adjust.

Yep. It was a medical facility, alright — and she was strapped down to the bed. Good times. Several pieces of sterile, complicated equipment were placed next to her. Most of them were making beeping noises. She lifted her head as high as the nylon straps allowed, trying to get a lay of the land.

A nurse and a doctor laid face-down on the floor. Pools of crimson crept out from under them. An older woman in an immaculate white suit was seated nearby; she held a gun. Her gaze was on Olivia.

Olivia blinked. She was wrong; it was a young man with a neon green mohawk. He wore a studded jacket splattered with something wet. In his left hand, he clutched a blood-soaked switch-blade.

She blinked again. It was a person of indeterminable gender; their skin was a deep shade of ochre, with a face full of piercings. They wore several leather straps around what looked like a charcoal binder. Instead of a knife, they held an aluminum baseball bat. It was coated with clumps of hair and meat.

She blinked again. A man with teeth like serrated steak knives and claws that could carve through steel. She blinked again. It was Anthony. She blinked again. It was Adam. She blinked again. It was Calvin.

She blinked again.

It was the Liar.

“How’s that cut feeling?”

Olivia looked down at her wrist. A fresh series of stitches criss-crossed over a recently opened wound; it extended from the base of her palm to nearly the inside of her elbow.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" A distant memory tugged at the back of her mind.

She licked her lips and lied. “It… doesn’t hurt that much.”

“Still. Make sure to keep it covered. Antibiotics, too.” The left side of the Liar’s mouth twitched upward. “They would have prescribed something for it, but I’m afraid I killed them before they had the opportunity.”

“Who…” Olivia’s eyes fell to the figures on the floor. “What’s going on? Who are they?”

“They worked for me, and we captured you,” the Liar told her. “You were brought to me for… processing. To discover what you knew; to determine if you had the journal. Or, at the very least, if you knew what was in it.” Their lips pursed with amusement. "You know, after all this time I had forgotten it ever existed. When the agent who penned it defected and told us what it contained, you'd have thought we might have taken steps to make its contents untrue. But… we are nothing if not creatures of habit."

Olivia couldn’t remember anything after they killed the Accountant. The Liar must have noticed her confusion: “You’ve been amnesticized. Several times, actually. Did you know that’s my primary function within the Foundation? To maintain the veil. To make sure no one remembers anything they’re not supposed to.”

They tapped the weapon against their thigh. “And, of course, to replace those gaps with convincing lies.”

“Why am I still alive? Why are we even having this conversation?”

“Because you and your friends accounted for this. Because you did have the journal. Or, at least, a small piece of it. A subdermal flash-drive, located under your wrist.”

“I don’t understand.”

The Liar smiled. Although Olivia could no longer recognize their features, she could still make out the weariness in their face. “Not all cognitohazards are anomalous.”

The code-phrase flashed through Olivia’s mind. It was as if she had just found the piece of a puzzle she hadn’t even realized she was solving. An image surged into her memories; she now remembered everything.""")

“You used to be one of us,” she whispered. “You used to be part of the Insurgency. You were part of the third Delta - I've heard Anthony talk about you.

The Liar closed their eyes and nodded. “That's true, but I didn't give up my memories because there were no memories to give up."

They sighed. "I was deployed to locate an anomaly in the Bengal Sea. Our ship capsized in a storm and I was dragged into the ocean when my leg got caught in some netting. I drifted in the darkness where the eyes are empty and sunk into the Void. They found me, months later, and the Foundation recognized who I was - what I could do. They gave me to Green - that witch - and she gave me a new identity; a lie to believe in.” They opened their eyes and rose to their feet, approaching Olivia. “Your friend Calvin found out from the journal no doubt, that clever boy. Your copy only had that entry in it - the entry containing my name. Seeing it for the first time in so many years… it was like coming up from under water after so long.”

The Liar began unbinding Olivia’s limbs. “I’ve cleared a path to the front entrance. It will be open for another ten minutes; once you’re out, you’ll find a grey van in the parking lot. The doors are unlocked; the keys are in the glove compartment. You’ll find instructions, a map, and a flash-drive.”

“A flash-drive?” Olivia sat up, feeling her extremities tingle with the sudden surge of blood. Her forearm pulsed with pain.

“It contains crucial data — including the location of your next target. The Archivist.” The Liar stepped back. “Out of all of us, she may be the furthest gone. Tell your friends to be careful.”

The truth has set me free.” They sank back into their chair, laying their weapon across their lap. “Move fast. Your window is closing.”

Olivia reached out to touch the Liar’s hand. They did not look up. Turning to go, she spared one last look at them; for a moment, she thought she might have recognized a face. Then, she made her way out into the hall and toward the exit.

It wasn’t until she reached the stairwell that she heard that single, lonely shot.

## THE SPEAR AND THE SERPANT

THEN

— - —

In the stillness of the tiny apartment, Vincent Arians sipped his drink. A half-finished bottle and a loaded pistol sat on the countertop nearby. Thin bands of twilight peeked in through the slits of the blinds, illuminating the prone form of Aaron Siegel on the ground in front of him.

Arians sat the glass aside and took a long drag on a cigarette, his eyes squinting against the luminescence. A moment later, Aaron stirred. He pushed himself up onto his elbows, one hand wiping sleep and saliva out of his beard. His face, puffy and red, turned to face Arians.

“What happened?” he croaked. “Where are we?” He looked down at his hands. They were still trembling. “Did it work?”

Arians took another drag of the cigarette. Smoke flowed slowly out of his nostrils, catching the light in front of him. He was barely visible behind the haze. “He’s dead.” Arians’ eyes focused on some point in the distance. “It worked.”

For a long moment, Aaron did not move.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Then — suddenly — he slammed his fist into the ground.

“Yes,” he hissed through his clenched jaw. “Yes.”

Arians’ expression was distant. “We almost died, you know.” He dribbled ash on the carpet to his right. “Some of us didn’t make it.”

Aaron staggered upright, then fell down with his back against the wall. He held out his hand; Arians passed him the cigarette.

“How many?” Aaron asked.

“You and I. Felix. Conrad. Ingrid.” Arians counted on his fingers. “Five total. Felix has already reached out to researchers at other sites. Some of them are reaching out to us. Everyone is scared shitless.” He took another drink. “Thought you might be dead.”

Aaron rubbed his temples. “I don’t remember much.” He looked over at Arians. “You look younger.”

“Yeah. We all do. That water will do that.” He finished his glass. “We’ve got a lot of work to do, Aaron. But before we start, you need to tell me why you did it.”

Aaron shook his head. “It doesn’t matter now. It’s done.”

“Fuck you. It does matter.” Something had changed; there was a distance between them. “We did things — I did things — that will haunt me till the day I die. But we did them anyway, because we were saving the world. You had the chance to destroy Abaddon. And you didn’t.”

His voice grew hard and cold. “You told me to run the moment you activated them, the Children. You told me not to ask why. So that’s what I did. I trusted you, because you’ve never given me a reason not to. But now? I’ve got several. You need to tell me why you killed Frederick Williams.”

They were silent for a good, long while. Aaron worked on finishing the cigarette; Arians poured himself another drink. As he leaned back against the wall, Aaron could see faint, pinkish swelling around Arians’ eyes.

“There was no Abaddon,” Aaron finally said. “There never was. It was bait.”

Arians drew in a ragged breath. “How do you know?”

“Because he told me, Vince.”

“What?”

“And when I didn’t believe him,” Aaron continued, “he showed me.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""” He let the silence speak for him; when he grew tired of what it had to say, he went on. “It was just before the Congo site. I was there, with him.” Aaron exhaled. Wisps of smoke swirled from his nostrils, climbing toward the ceiling.

Arians said nothing. Aaron examined the cigarette. “I don’t know what the hell he is. He was probably human, once. Maybe. But not anymore. He can do things — impossible things. When the site fell…” He closed his eyes. “I watched him level an entire facility, Vincent. One man. That’s all it took. That’s all Abaddon was.”

“Why would he—”

Aaron’s eyes opened. “I think he saw in me a kindred spirit.” Then, softer: “I watched him press through concrete and rebar as if they were soft, wet paste. I watched a man exhale his own skeleton as a thick, yellow fog. I watched a woman’s blood solidify into crystal — as sharp as diamond and as brittle as chalk. He let me watch, because he knew no one would believe me. He let me watch, because… I think he wanted to see what I would do.”

Arians struggled to speak; his voice caught in his throat. “So you destroyed him.”

Aaron was very still. “Yes. I knew I didn’t have the kind of power I needed to kill him, and…” He stopped and stood up, searching for another bottle. When he found one, he didn’t look at the label. He poured himself another drink.

“Maybe he wanted to see if I could — if I would. Maybe he just wanted to see that power himself. In some of his correspondence, early on, he would describe anomalies as ‘glorious’. He talked about them like you might talk about a sunrise. I think… I don’t know. I don’t think it was ever enough for him. I don’t think anything was.” Aaron finished his glass in a single pull.

“He’s the cancer, Vince. It wasn’t Abaddon. It was the Administrator. He had to be destroyed. The whole thing had to be destroyed. It was rotten down to its core.” He lifted the bottle to pour himself another drink.

Arians’ breathing was heavy and shaking.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" It took him a moment to speak again — and when he did, he trembled with a barely-suppressed sob.

“If you knew… this whole time — we could’ve stopped, Aaron. We could’ve — we could’ve spared them, we could’ve—”

Aaron brought the bottle down hard. “No, Vince. We needed the Children. If we didn’t have them, I wouldn’t have been able to—”

Arians’ voice swelled with fury. “We sliced them open and cut into their fucking brains!”

Aaron grimaced. Arians reached for the counter, steadying himself. “I — I strapped children down to fucking operating tables, Aaron. I strapped them down and I helped you carve out every last inch of who they were. They screamed and screamed, and we kept carving. And then the screams got softer, and softer, until they were just tiny, broken sounds, little wet sobs you had to strain to hear, and then, one day they didn’t make any sound at all, and…”

Arians’ voice fell into shaky, wheezing breaths. He closed his eyes and counted to ten.

“You said Dr. Williams just wanted to see if it could be done. But what about you?” He opened his eyes. “Why didn’t you stop it?”

“I told you. We needed it to kill—”

“I don’t believe you.”

Neither spoke.

Arians pushed himself away from the counter. “Once the Foundation collapses, we’ll have a lot of work to do.” His voice was treacherously calm; like a razor-thin layer of ice spread across the surface of dark water.

“Felix is assembling the researchers and finding us a space to operate from. They all think the Administrator aligned himself with Abaddon. They think you’re some sort of hero. They expect you to lead. And that’s precisely what you’re going to do.”

“Vince.” Aaron turned to him, his eyes glassy and wide — as if viewing something from a distance. “You saw it too, didn’t you? The moment that it happened — that it destroyed him. That moment, you saw it. Didn’t you?”

“Yeah. I saw it.”

“Wasn’t it…” Aaron searched for the right word. “Wasn’t it…”

“It was nothing,” Arians replied.""")

Adam spat, wiping cobwebs from his face. “You know that I hate bugs, right?”

Calvin laughed. “I can’t imagine they’re thrilled with you, either.”

The thick morning fog seeped out between the trees. It gave the forest a dull, amber-gold luster. A chittering chorus of insects surrounded them both, as if to berate them for their intrusion. Dead leaves crackled beneath them with each step into the woods.

Adam kept mopping away at his mouth. “And magic. If I were writing a list of things I’d hate, that’s what the list would be. ‘Bugs and magic’. So you bring me along on the one mission that has both.” He paused to spit out another bit of webbing. “Why me? Why not Anthony, or Olivia? This seems like their kind of deal.”

“Olivia’s busy dealing with the Liar.” Calvin retrieved the journal from his pocket. He opened it and flipped through several pages. “As for Anthony, he’s getting intel on the Outsider.”

“Okay. Fine. But this lady — she’s basically some sort of wizard, right? How are we going to deal with that? You’ve got some sort of plan, yeah?”

“I’ve got several.” Calvin turned the page, reading as they walked.

“Well, what are they?”

“Most of them consist of shooting her in the face.”

“That’s…” Adam scowled. “That’s not a plan.”

“It’s worked out pretty well so far.” Calvin looked up from the journal, casting a glance back to Adam. “And if things get heated, I’ve got… something. A weapon.”

“What is it?”

“Can’t tell you.”

“Seriously? C’mon, that’s—”

“No,” Calvin cut him off. “I mean I literally can’t tell you.” He closed the journal and stopped walking. “We’re here.”

Adam’s scowl only deepened. He looked around the clearing. “I don’t see anything. How can you even tell?”

“Listen.”

Adam stopped. He listened.

Silence.

“You know how the Foundation contains some pretty intense anomalies, right? Things that, if left unchecked, could end the world?”

“Yeah.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""” Adam leaned back against a tree, scanning the clearing. The quiet — the sense of stillness — it was overpowering. Breaking it almost felt vulgar. “Right.”

“And you know how the Foundation has existed for, oh, I don’t know — maybe only around a century or two?” Calvin squeezed the journal into his pocket.

Adam nodded. “Right.”

“Then here’s your history quiz: If the Foundation contains so many world-ending anomalies, and the Foundation has only existed for a century, who was containing those anomalies before them?”

Adam tried hard not to roll his eyes. “No one. Anomalies didn’t exist before the Foundation. The Overseers created them to gain immortality. C’mon, seriously? This is kid’s stuff.”

“But that’s not quite it. Because there are anomalies that predate the Foundation. And besides, how do you ‘create’ anomalies if they never existed in the first place?”

Adam folded his arms across his chest and wrinkled his brow in thought.

“All that’s really happened,” Calvin continued, walking toward one edge of the clearing, “is that the number of anomalies has started to increase substantially. The Foundation didn’t create the problem — they just made the problem much, much worse.”

“How?”

Calvin reached his destination. Two young saplings stood, side-by-side. He closed his eyes, took a breath, and extended his arm out between them.

His hand vanished up to the wrist.

Adam’s eyes went as wide as saucers. Calvin pulled his arm back; his hand reappeared, unscathed. He turned around and held it out for Adam to see, wriggling his fingers. “They tugged on threads not meant to be tugged. They tried to use them — even harness them.”

“What the hell is—”

“A Way. A tunnel between worlds; a piece of frayed, unraveled thread.” Calvin faced the saplings, extending his arm again. “In order to pass through this one, you need to have the right Knock.”

Adam walked toward Calvin, staring at the space where the older man’s arm terminated.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “A — what?”

“Something that opens the Way. Sometimes it’s just the time of day, or something you’re carrying; other times it’s a ritual, or a word, or a thought. In this case, it’s a piece of knowledge. Something important to you.” Calvin looked back to Adam. “You’ll forget whatever it is when you press through.”

“Uh…”

“Think of some tiny piece of information you like knowing, but don’t have to know. Then step between the saplings. Also, just to warn you upfront — it’s a pretty intense ride.” Calvin turned and stepped forward. He vanished.

Adam stared at the space where Calvin had been for a good, long while. Then, he exhaled, closed his eyes, and stepped forward. Did he really need to know what THAC0 stood for?

It hit him all at once: Space and matter became as stretchable as taffy. The woods pulled away; air rushed to greet him. It was like he was accelerating through a tunnel at breakneck speed — a tunnel made of light and sound, extending out forever.

The world roared around him. He tried to talk, tried to yell, tried to scream — but every sound he made was torn from his lips and sent spinning back behind him into the void. Cold, distant stars watched from above and below.

And then — as if the universe was a rubber-band that had been released — everything snapped back into place.

Adam lunged forward, landing on his hands and chest.

“You alright? I told you, it’s pretty intense.” Calvin reached down to help Adam to his feet.

They were inside, now. The air was unusually cool; the floor was smooth, flat, and orange. As Adam stood up, he searched the space around them.

“This is…” Adam struggled to find the right words.

They were inside a massive office space, illuminated by dozens of long, narrow fluorescent bulbs. Dozens of refrigerator-sized mainframes hummed quietly along the room’s walls. Adam didn’t recognize the models, but if he had to wager a guess, he’d place them as something from the mid-80s.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The sort that used record-sized magnetic plates for hard disks.

Several desks with large, bulky monochrome monitors were arranged around them. Adam even saw what looked like an old microfiche machine — the last time he’d seen one of those had been in his dad’s attic.

“—not what I was expecting.”

Halls extended from all four sides of the room, leading into additional rooms — at a glance, they appeared similarly equipped. The hallways kept going, extending as far as they could see — or until a piece of equipment obscured their view.

“Hello?” Calvin started down one of the halls, but didn’t leave the entry-room. “Anyone home?” No reply — just the hum of countless mainframes. “There should be someone here.”

“This place is, uh… what is this place?” Adam approached one of the mainframes, inspecting it. Each machine had a sleek logo — the image of snake with brilliant emerald eyes and a silver crown. “These machines look older than me.”

“They probably are.” Calvin frowned, glancing back to Adam. “This is part of the Library. The Foundation uses it to archive all the works of the worlds that came before. Art, literature, music — written works, printed works — any kind of information.”

“On microfilm.” Adam did not sound impressed. “Wait, ‘came before’?”

“Yes. We need to find a Librarian. This place is effectively infinite; get lost here and you’ll starve before you find another soul.”

“A Librarian?” Adam was examining one of the computers more closely, now. “Hey, this one’s not running.”

“Yeah, a Librarian. They’re part of the Library, they know where everything —” Calvin stopped, turning to face Adam. “Wait, what?”

“This computer. It’s not running.” Adam had already pulled out an unfolding tool-kit, and was working on unscrewing the front panel. “It’s plugged in, switch is on, but it’s not making any noise.”

Calvin approached. “Don’t mess with it.”

“Why not? Hell, why not just destroy them?” Adam replied.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" By the time Calvin reached him, he had already gotten the fourth screw out, and was lifting the panel up.

“That would be very bad, Adam. They don’t just use these to archive lost worlds — they use them as backups for information on the anomalies they’re containing. If they lost these mainframes, they could lose critical information they need to keep anomalies—”

The panel slid free. The interior was nearly empty; the wires had been stripped away, leaving only the hard disk’s magnetic plate. A dense, winding script of sigils were carved along its surface. As they watched, the plate slowly rotated — despite having no discernible power source.

“The fuck is that?” Adam asked.

Calvin grasped Adam by the shoulder and pulled him back. “Don’t touch it,” he hissed.

“What is it?”

“It is of Daevite origin.” The voice came from behind them. They spun around — Calvin’s hand went for the pistol at his hip, while Adam gripped his screw-driver like a knife.

The creature stood over them both; narrow and slender, it wore a robe of shimmering silver. Its hood was pulled across its face, cloaking its features. Still, Adam could make out a hint of its skin — pale, with a slight emerald tint. It had a rough, scaly texture.

Calvin kept the pistol leveled at its chest for just a moment; then, he slowly lowered it. “A Librarian.”

Adam lowered the screwdriver. “We’re looking for the Archivist.”

“She is here no longer,” the Librarian informed them.

“Where is she?” Calvin frowned. “And what the hell is Daevite technology doing inside a Foundation server?”

“Also, the hell is a Daevite?” Adam added.

“She has broken her pact with the Serpent, and partaken of forbidden knowledge. She has written herself into a story to which she does not belong. As for where she is now- if you seek her,” the Librarian told them, “I will take you to her — down below.”

Then they descended.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Long staircases led to long planes of endless rows of books, art galleries full of strange and terrible works, narrow hallways throughout which tinkling music could be heard. Every door they passed was another universe worth of knowledge, and still further they descended. Adam knew that time was passing strangely here; he could not say how long they traveled or how long they had been in this place. When he thought to look up, he realized he could no longer see the top of the Library, and yet still further they descended.

After a lifetime, the stairs ended. Their feet struck stone again, and the steps behind them disappeared into shadow. The dark was intense here; even the Librarian’s torch seemed dimmer and cast less light. They walked for a while in this dark place, through a massive cavern lined with titanic stone columns that extended up into the black above them.

“This is the foundation of the Library,” they heard the Librarian say, the first words they had heard in decades. “These pillars were forged by the Serpent itself in the eternity before time. All knowledge rests upon them.”

Adam coughed. “A snake built this?”

The Librarian looked at him queerly. “The Serpent is called the Serpent in your world, because that is how it manifests outside of these halls. In here, and in the Dark Endlessness below here, the Serpent takes many shapes.”

“Dark Endlessness? What’s that?”

“You call the Serpent what you call it because that is how you perceive it, but that is not what it is. The Serpent is the avatar of one of the universal facets of reality: information. The idea that ideas can exist at all, or that all things have inherent truths about them.” It paused. “Below here is the emptiness outside of life and death, nothingness. The Serpent’s silent brother is the lord of that quiet oblivion. Anything that ventures there ceases to exist at all.”

The Librarian stopped and turned to face them.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “This foundation is a barrier between that which is, and that which isn’t. Beyond these doors,” it extended a hand, and in front of them they could make out two massive bronze doors through the darkness, “is the source of all knowledge, the center of the foundation on which the Serpent built the library. Within this chamber are three tomes that mustn't be disturbed. They are fundamental to our universe, and indeed, all universes. You’ll recognize them when they see them.”

Calvin nodded. "Before we go in, I'd like to make a withdrawal."

The Librarian nodded slowly, and pulled back its robe. From within it produced a short metal tube inscribed across its entire surface with runes. “When you brought this to us all those years ago, we were not certain you would ever return to claim it. But you are much different now than you were then, I think." The Librarian looked the cylinder over carefully. "There are very few things that exist that our Library has no knowledge of. The contents of this container are one such anomaly. I hope it brings you good fortune.”

Adam took the tube and held it in his hands. When he looked up to speak, the Librarian was gone. The torch still hung in the air where she had been. The doors stood before them.

“Well,” Calvin said, pulling out his sidearm and checking the magazine, “let’s go.”

They pushed the doors open and stepped inside. As they passed through the threshold, Adam felt the same nauseating rush as he did when they had first stepped into the Way. After a moment it passed, and he opened his eyes.

They stood at the top of a rolling hill covered in green grass. Above them was a blue sky dotted with white clouds. Below them was a valley, and in the center of the valley were two trees. Under one of them was a woman sitting cross legged in a simple white dress. At her feet sat two books. A third was in her hand, and she read it as she quietly chewed on a red piece of fruit.

The woman didn’t acknowledge them as they entered.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" She had brown hair and wore glasses. Adam guessed she was in her thirties. As they got closer he could see flecks of grey at her roots. The book in her hand was bound in leather with gold trim, and looked ancient. Something was written in small gold type on the front, but neither Adam nor Calvin could make it out. As they approached, Calvin spoke to her.

“You’re the Archivist?” he said.

The woman nodded.

Calvin nodded in response. He pulled his firearm and leveled it point-blank at her forehead, and fired three shots. The Archivist didn’t so much as flinch. After the noise had echoed out of the space around them, she raised her eyes slowly to look at him. Her face was clear of bullet holes.

“Do you read, Calvin?” she said.

Calvin pulled the magazine out of the gun and flipped it into his pocket, pulling another from a clip on his belt. “No,” he replied, “can’t say I’ve had much time for reading recently.” He cocked the gun and pointed at her again. “So what is this, some sort of incorporeal thing? Do I need sacred bullets to do the job, maybe something in silver?” He popped off three more shots. The Archivist didn’t look away from him.

“I read,” she said, closing the book in her hand and setting it on the ground next to a half-eaten piece of fruit. “In fact, I read very often. I’m a writer, you see, and the only way for a writer to perfect their craft is to write, and to read.”

She leaned her head back against the tree and was looking him square in the face now. “Do you know how much you can learn from reading? I do. It’s a lot. In fact, you can learn so much from reading there’s almost no reason to do anything else. You can live a billion lifetimes just in books. You can learn everything there is to learn, just in books. For example, did you know there’s a book in this library written to teach the reader how to allow bullets to pass through their body as if they’re not even there? I know. I read that book. I read all the books.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

She closed her eyes and began tapping her fingers against the top of the thick book next to her. “When I heard you killed poor Felix, I’ll admit, I was afraid. The concept of death is so foreign to us now, and it’s been such a long time since I’ve had to worry about it. My task becomes considerably more difficult when faced with the prospect of mortality. I’m a writer, you see, and I have to document everything that happens within the Foundation, and on Earth. I can’t do either of those things if I’m dead.”

“I came down here because I thought I might learn the secret of immortality in one of these books. As it turns out, I didn’t need the books, not at first. Have you felt how time is different here? It’s a gift from the Serpent; you have all the time you need to learn what you need to learn while you’re in the Library.”

She smiled. “I’ve been here for some time.”

Calvin sighed. “So you’re going to keep reading until you figure out how to become immortal?”

Her eyes popped open. “Oh no, certainly not. I’ve already figured that out. In fact, I’ve already done it.”

She motioned to the trees behind her. “These trees are special. This one here, this is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. That one, that’s the Tree of Life. The Tree of Knowledge grants knowledge, and the Tree of Life grants life. But the Serpent is wily. The Serpent made these trees, and cursed them. You can only eat from one if you’ve already eaten from the other. That produces a paradox then, doesn’t it? How do you eat from one if you can’t eat from it until you’ve eaten from the other, which requires you to have eaten from the first?”

She uncrossed her legs and stood up. “I’ve been down here for a very long time. I knew there would be an answer here somewhere, some secret that I had missed. By the time I realized there was no secret, I had read every book in this Library. Every piece of knowledge contained here is contained within me.”

She gestured lazily at the Tree of Knowledge.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “I had wondered once about why this tree doesn’t bear fruit. It’s because the Library is the fruit. I had already consumed it.”

She cracked her neck and rolled her shoulders. “I knew the Serpent would come down here eventually. The Serpent knew that the only pieces of the fruit I hadn’t consumed yet were these three: The Book of Life and Death, The Book of Things That Have Been, and The Book of Things That Will Be. I imagine it would have very much liked for me to not read these.” Her back arched and they could hear something snap along her spine. “It doesn’t matter now. The Serpent is the keeper of the Library. The Serpent knows of all things within the Library. I know of all things within the Library. I am the Serpent.”

They watched in horror as the Archivist’s skin began to split, starting at the base of her spine and creeping up her back. Her eyes bulged in their sockets and blood began to seep out of her like water from a sponge. Her mouth opened as if to scream, but instead a long, forked tongue appeared, and then the base of a fanged mouth. With a wet, thick tear, her entire body came apart down the center and a massive, writhing serpent appeared from within. It’s eyes were black slits, and across the ridge of its emerald back were gemstones that dazzled in the ethereal light of the meadow. Floating above its head was a pointed silver crown emblazoned with a dark ouroboros.

The Serpent coiled around to face them, the edges of its mouth turned up ever so slightly in a horrific grin. It blinked, and when it did they could see the Archivist’s jade eyes again for a moment.

“There is one thing that nags at me,” it said, lifting itself up to its full immense height, “is the contents of that tube you are holding, Adam Ivanov. What a queer thing, to be unknown to That Which Gave Birth To Knowledge. I’ll have to find out myself.”

The Serpent’s mouth opened wide, its fangs glistening, and it lunged at Adam.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The young man had only a moment to duck out of the way as the Serpent turned and came after him again, narrowly missing his feet as he rolled out of the way. Adam heard the familiar pop of gunshots, and look to see Calvin firing at the back of the Serpent’s head. The snake turned, its eyes dark again, and brought its tail down, nearly crushing Calvin in the process.

“I think the time has passed for shooting her in the face!” Adam shouted as Calvin reloaded. Adam scrambled back towards his feet and produced his own firearm, emptying several fruitless rounds into the monster’s side. As he did, he noticed the tranquil valley around them beginning to come apart. Large fissures were forming in the ground, splitting the land and in some places falling away completely. In the exposed holes, Adam could see only darkness that extended on forever below them. Above them, the sky began to lose its blue, becoming a solemn shade of grey. The only color in the world was the gemstones on the Serpent’s back, and its dazzling silver crown.

Calvin fired again, and then again. The Serpent lunged at him as he deftly stepped out of the way. He caught the edge of the crown, which pealed like a bell and made the air around them vibrate. As he paused to steady himself, the Serpent’s tail came around and crashed into him, sending him sliding across the grey grass. Adam fired, and the bullets ricocheted off of the beast’s back.

The Serpent turned towards him, its tongue darting out between fangs as tall as he was. Adam stood stock still, his body frozen, and dropped his gun. The Serpent began to coil up before him, as if to strike, and he could feel the animalistic urges of his body begging him to run, to flee, to do anything to protect himself. But he did nothing.

Then he heard Calvin shouting from his right.

“Adam! The tube! Open the tube!”

His shock was broken in an instant. With a swift tug and a hearty yank, Adam freed the cap of the canister, and opened it towards the ground.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He felt a sudden weight on the tube as some long, thick, and heavy slid out from it.

It was a dark, smooth wooden shaft, inlaid with markings and runes burned into the wood. Near its end was a thick metal band, and at its fore was a fierce and menacing spearhead. Eyeing it over quickly, Adam could see the words “-is the non-believer, against whom divinity holds no sway-” before he had to duck out of the way again as the Serpent came at him. He drug the spear behind him, and shouted panickedly to Calvin.

“Hey, I don’t know what this is, but I don’t think it’s going to help!” he said. “I can’t even- fuck! I can’t even lift it!”

At a word, the canister he had deposited on the ground began to spin and shake. Several interlocking sections began to unfold, and more canister seemed to materialize from nowhere. As Adam scurried away from the striking Serpent, the canister behind him shaped and folded itself up into a large mechanical rack. Calvin noticed it first, and shouted to get Adam’s attention.

“There, look!” He gestured towards the rack as he reloaded his pistol. “It’s a harpoon! Put it on the harpoon gun!”

Adam’s incredulity nearly cost him his life, as the Serpent came at him sideways and knocked him onto the ground. The Serpent struck at him, its fangs finding only soil as Adam dragged the spear through the grass. He heard the crack of Calvin’s weapon again and again, but kept his head down as he struggled to maneuver around the collapsing ground beneath him. Upon reaching the harpoon gun, itself a mess of gears, pulleys, and steel, he heaved the spear up on the rack and began to wind it backwards. With the spear in place and the gun loaded, he turned towards the Serpent and froze in panic.

The Serpent had Calvin wrapped tightly in its tail, the older man dangling precariously over the rent ground beneath them. The Serpent hissed and smiled again at Adam, and shook Calvin slightly.

“There, there,” the Serpent said, “let’s not be so hasty.""")

I’ve seen things that would turn your heart to ice.

I wasn’t able to see it before, but now that I do… well, you know it doesn’t matter, right?”

“I can kill you right now,” Adam snarled, aiming the spear at the Serpent’s face, “it wouldn’t take even a second.”

“Even if you could,” the Serpent said, its voice like velvet and smoke, “and you can’t, why would you want to? Do you even know what it is you’re doing? Do you even know what you’re trying to accomplish?”

“Kill the Thirteen Foundation Overseers,” Adam said through gritted teeth, his finger shaking against the trigger.

“Why?”

“You’ve twisted the universe to suit your craven desires,” Adam spat. “You’ve made a mockery of the natural order. Your influence is a cancer.”

The Serpent seemed to sigh. “Fanaticism. Even with all the knowledge in the world, I’ll never understand you.” With a swift tug, it crushed Calvin and dropped him into the void.

Adam stood unmoving, his hand clenched around the handle of the weapon. The Serpent began to move towards him.

“You think you’re the first person with dreams of destroying the wicked and terrible SCP Foundation? Be realistic, Adam. I have lived a thousand lives and dreamed a thousand more. I’ve seen this world turned over time and time again, and dutifully recorded it all. Do you think there’s anything you could do that I cannot foresee? Do you think there’s anything that would stand between me and my duty?” It flicked its tail towards the harpoon gun. “Put that silly thing away. I’ve eaten the fruit of the Tree of Life.""")

With a rush, the spear roared through the air towards the Serpent, which had gotten close enough as to be unable to move out of the way in time. The spear buried itself in the Serpent’s skull with a sickening crunch, and the monster recoiled and screamed. Smoke poured from the gaping wound on its head as it thrashed, and Adam had to fall to the ground to avoid being smashed as the Serpent’s tail swung around and flattened the harpoon gun.

The world around him began to vibrate, slowly at first and then building in intensity until the very air seemed to shake. The sky grew black and thick bands of light began to pour through cracks in it, and the ground below him undulated and churned and eventually fell away. The last thing Adam saw before he was plunged into darkness was the Serpent, silhouetted against the falling sky, with a shining silver spear protruding victoriously from its face like a serpentine unicorn.

When Adam came to, he felt cool grass beneath his head. His neck ached, and his limbs thundered their disapproval of his trying to move them as he sat up. He rubbed against his temples, trying to focus - how long had he been falling? - but opened his eyes with a start when he heard hoarse coughing nearby. Laying a few paces from him was Calvin, covered in sweat and blood and looking profoundly shaken, but no worse for wear. As Adam approached him, Calvin turned to look at the young man and smiled.

"Hey," he said, laughing through bloody teeth, "we didn't die."

Adam laughed. Taking a moment to survey his surroundings, he found himself on the same grassy hillside from before, but the sky was once again blue and the grass was once again green. His eyes traced a path of blood up to one of the two trees on top of the hill, where a woman in a simple dress was skewered to one of them by a massive spear driven through her skull.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Her face was unrecognizable, and her white dress was now stained with her own lifeblood.

There was a figure standing over her. It was tall and lean, like the librarian but simpler somehow. It too wore a robe that covered its face and obscured its features, but this robe was a much more vibrant green. The figure was stooped slightly, and from where he stood Adam could see it wasn't looking at the woman impaled on the spear, but the spear itself.

Adam helped Calvin to his feet, and together the two of them walked slowly and carefully up the hill towards the figure. As they approached, they became acutely aware of another figure, one they couldn't quite discern, standing behind the one in the green robes. Whatever that figure was hurt them to look at, and so save a few scant glances they avoided doing so. When they reached the top of the hill, the figure turned to look at them. They couldn't see its face, but something about it felt strangely familiar.

"Ah, you're awake," the figure said, its voice soft and smooth. "I had feared the worst. This Library contains a great many truths, but little is said about crossing the plane between That Which Is and That Which Isn't. In fact, unless I'm mistaken this is the first time a person has ever crossed that barrier and come back. That is no mean feat at all."

The figure in green gestured to the dark figure behind it. "Fortunately for you, the powers that be seem to have determined that it is not time for you to slip these bonds. Not yet, anyway." It tapped a long, gloved finger against its head. "Yes, very rare."

Calvin coughed and found his voice. "Who are you?"

The figure in green didn't seem to hear him. "This thing you have here, this is a queer thing." It reached down and laid a hand on the spear embedded into one of the trees. "There is something strange about it. The Library decided to hold it for you, but the Library didn't know what it was. That is very rare indeed."

The figure paused for a moment.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" "Do you know what this is?"

They shook their heads. The figure nodded. "This is called the Spear of the Non-Believer. It is an ancient weapon, older perhaps than even this Library. There are legends that say it was forged when the first thinking being decided to deny omnipotence. To stand alone against insurmountable might. It is very, very strange indeed." The figure made a noise that might have been laughter. "In fact, I can't even see it. How strange."

The figure looked to Calvin. "How you acquired this - someone gave it to you, yes?"

Calvin nodded.

The figure stood back up to its full height. "Now that is peculiar."

With a deft hand, the figure reached out and pulled the shaft free from the tree and, with its other, slid the broken corpse of the Overseer off the end. It held the spearhead up towards its face, studying it intensely. "Very, very strange. I feel as if this item doesn't care for me at all."

The figure reached down and pulled the slim metal canister off the ground, and quickly slid the entire length of the spear into it, which disappeared entirely despite the disparity in length between the two. The figure turned and handed the canister to Adam, who reached out and took it.

"You know," the figure said, turning now to look at the woman laying in a pool of blood at its feet, "I had known her for some time. When she first entered these halls, she was not so different than either of you. However, her intentions - pure though they may have been - were what led her to this point. Your convictions do truly make you remarkable beings, capable of endless wonders and horrors."

It looked back at them one more time, and Calvin became aware that he was being watched. "I wonder where your convictions will lead you?"

There was a blinding flash of light and a burst of heat, and a moment later they were standing in the forest again.

## A LIFE UNLIVED

THEN

Aaron Siegel sat in the back room of a bustling Somali warehouse. Through the cracks in the blinds he could see people moving to and fro; the first faint breaths of their new Insurgency. He thought the name was ridiculous — most of them did — but ridiculous was part of the equation. Make them believe you’re incompetent. Make them think it’s not an act. Their footprint was small, but growing steadily. Already they had raided three Foundation storehouses in Africa, with another team preparing for a third. Make them think it’s not an act.

But Aaron Siegel sat uncomfortably. The week before, they got word that work had begun on a new facility in Italy. There wasn’t a sign on the door identifying it as a Foundation site, but all the signs were there. At the same time, three new unmarked ships were seen patrolling the waters near their Somali headquarters.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Reports of task forces being deployed in the United States. Dark planes over the Antarctic.

He sat uncomfortably because these were not the choked final breaths of a dying organization. Frederick Williams was dead, annihilated by the finger of God Himself. Most of the O5 research team, the senior leadership of the fledgling Foundation, had either been killed in the ensuing chaos or defected along with Aaron and Arians. Many others had left their posts to join them too, for any number of ideological reasons. The Chaos Insurgency. Yet even in the midst of their greatest defeat, the Foundation continued on. Their operations seemed untouched.

And Aaron Siegel sat uncomfortably.

The telephone on his desk rang out its piercing notice, and Aaron moved to answer it. He hesitated; the phone had only ever seemed to want to bring him bad news. Another shipment lost. Foundation sites increasing security. More sites under construction. Everything they had sacrificed, everything he had given up, would be for nothing if the Foundation and its efforts were not ground to a halt. The fear of failure, of the reckoning of his sins, stayed his hand for a moment.

But Aaron Siegel answered the phone.

“Can you hear the black wolf howl at the moon?,” said Arians, his rough tenor barely audible across their meager connection.

“Vincent,” Aaron sighed in relief. His friend’s voice was a welcome reprieve, even in spite of its tone. “You’re well?”

“I’ve told you a thousand times,” Arians growled over the receiver, “finish the phrase. It’s a security measure. We cannot be compromised, especially not now.”

Aaron’s heart dropped slightly. “What news?”

Arians paused. “They’re moving to South America. The Broken God fanatics are involved in some activity there. The Foundation is shipping out en masse.”

“How many?” Aaron felt himself ask.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

“Two hundred, maybe three hundred men,” Arians said, “and that’s not including some other staff members they’re moving in from other sites in the region. It’s a full on escalation, Aaron.”

Aaron sunk into his chair. The receiver of the phone felt heavy in his hand, and he heard a distance cackling that swept over him in waves. How could this be happening? They should be in ruins.

“Aaron?” Arians’ voice shocked him and brought him back to reality with a start.

“Yes, yes, sorry, I just… Vince, how is this happening? What did we do wrong?”

Arians was quiet for a moment. “Maybe Sophia was just more resourceful than we anticipated. Look, Aaron,” he took a deep breath, “all I know is what we’re being told, and what we’re being told is that the Foundation is mobilizing to Mexico. We need to have boots on the ground there to try and disrupt their supply lines.”

Aaron nodded slowly to nobody but himself. “Yes… yes, you’re right. Of course. We’ll arrange transports for our agents in the region as soon as possible. Vince,” he began to say, hesitating.

“Yes?”

“I… I think I want to go with you on this one. I want to go to San Marco.”

“You… why?”

Aaron’s eyes descended to his desk. Sitting on the middle of it, tied up with red thread, was a small roll of paper. “I want to see them. I just need to see them again.”

“They’re not there. We’ve already had our agents in the area confirm that—”

“I just… just humor me, Vince. I’ll leave Felix in charge, he can handle things here while we’re away. I won’t be gone more than two weeks.”

Aaron could hear Arians’ discontentedness across a continent. “Fine. But you stay with me and my detachment, and you don’t get too close to whatever is happening in La Paz.”

Aaron agreed, and then hung up the phone.

He speaks to Sophia Light, who has taken to calling herself Sophia Nazarene, at a seminar hosted by Williams. She exudes confidence, and when she touches him on the arm he feels his hair standing up. That night, they fuck like animals. He asks about the scars on her wrists and the one on her side. She doesn’t answer.

He is standing with Frederick Williams and the rest of the Omega-5 research team. They pass around a glass of water, each taking a drink. Arians laughs. Aaron says, I bet you could live forever if you drank this stuff everyday. He notices Sophia stuffing a vial of the water into a bag. The next morning he wakes up without aches for the first time in a decade.

He is standing in a dark room. Twenty paces away he can see the stark, affixed face of Frederick Williams, illuminated by a thin, glowing, purple line in front of him. He is pulling on it with one finger. Every time he touches the line, the moon in the sky outside the window vanishes in a wink. Aaron Siegel calls to him, but he doesn’t look away. His eyes are black.

He is bleeding. He staggers against the wall, his hand clutching his side. He looks behind him and sees a man laying dead on the ground, his hand clasped around a bloodied, shattered golden sword. In the distance, a phone is ringing. He descends down an elevator. It feels like it goes on forever. A phone is ringing.

NOW

A gentle drizzle created an ambiance of soft pits and pats on the roof of the estate. The long, empty halls echoed the sound like constant, quiet thunder. One wing of the manor, long since burned and fallen into disarray, was naked to the elements, its furnishings ruined by looters or exposure. Standing in the doorway was a woman with lightly tanned skin and black hair that ran down behind her.""")

Her hand lingered for a moment over a picture frame, shattered on a long scorched end table. The glass had bubbled and cracked and the frame was blackened with soot, but the smiling faces of the image’s subjects still beamed through. She brushed away the ashes and picked away the errant pieces of glass, and pulled the photo out. Her tears mixed with the rain that soaked her skin.

“I know you’re there,” she said quietly, to nobody in particular. “You can come out now.”

Calvin emerged slowly from the shadows behind her, and Anthony from another corner. She didn’t turn to see them.

“I’m probably not who you’re looking for, huh?” she said, wiping her cheek with the back of her sleeve.

“No, you’re not,” Calvin said.

She nodded. “Whoever held my,” she gestured up and down on herself, “position, before it was given to me, ran afoul of the consensus.” She turned towards him, the picture in her hand clutched to her chest. “So I became the Ninth Overseer.”

“Who are you?” Anthony said.

She smiled. “At one point, my name was Donna Taylor. I was a-” she sniffled, “-sorry, I was a geologist. I took over for, uh… well, I don’t know who, to be honest. But needless to say the Foundation offered me something I needed very much at the time, and I didn’t know better.” She looked down at the picture. “Quite the coincidence, don’t you think?”

They didn’t respond.

She continued. “I didn’t seem to notice. I was glad to be employed, and the things they told me… work beyond my wildest dreams. I didn’t realize… it doesn’t matter. I’m sorry, I’ve been thinking about this a lot these past few weeks. I knew my day would come here before too long.”

“You know why I’m here.” Calvin said. It wasn’t a question.

She nodded again, wiping more tears from her eyes. “Yes, I… I do. I understand, I think. I don’t agree with you, you know, but I think I would see it different from your point of view.” She panned her eyes around behind him.""")

“They’re following a lead,” Anthony said, slowly drawing his sidearm. “Looking for the Eighth.”

She winced slightly. “They aren’t going to have much trouble.”

He nodded.

She looked at the gun in his hand. “You don’t have to do that. I don’t- I don’t want it to go that way.” She reached into her pocket and with a flick of her wrist produced a switchblade. She held it out in front of her, her eyes fixed on the blade’s edge.

“You know, at one point I used to think that serving a higher cause would immortalize you,” she said. “I thought that- that maybe a life given in service to something greater than yourself would make your death somehow more meaningful.” She laughed, tears freely streaming down her face. “It doesn’t really matter where you end up, though. Any death can be meaningless. Any life can be wasted.”

Suddenly she locked eyes with Calvin, and he felt an intensity surge through his body like nothing he’d ever felt before. The gun in his hand trembled, and the hairs on the back of his arms stood up. In his mind’s eye, he saw the manor around him restored, its halls filled with magnificence and its rooms full of laughter. He saw a father and his daughters fishing at the lake behind the house, and two boys wrestling over a toy nearby. He saw Christmases, and happy faces, and long night hours of studying over immense textbooks. He saw Donna Taylor and her loving parents, beaming towards a photographer after earning her doctorate. Then he saw fire, and heard screaming, and then he saw her standing in front of him again.

She was older now, he noticed. Her posture was slanted and her hair was thinner. With every breath she drew he could see the years weighing on her. But her eyes scorched the air around them with their intensity, and he could see the last desperate clarion call of a life unlived.""")

He gasped and stumbled as his vision grew blurry, as the pain in his chest split his skin and collapsed his veins.

And then she was standing in front of him again, her eyes dark. Calvin looked himself over, trembling in relief that he was unharmed. Anthony was grimacing from across the room. When Calvin looked up, he saw that the Overseer had collapsed into a burnt chair, and long streams of red were cascading down her wrists. She smiled weakly, her breath ragged and airy.

He holstered his gun and walked slowly towards her, careful to avoid the blood-stained knife on the ground. As he approached, she raised one pale arm towards him, and handed him the picture in her hand. He took it, and she relaxed.

“Why?” Calvin asked.

She shrugged. “It doesn’t matter.” She coughed, and blood pulsed out of her veins. Her eyes, hazy now and struggling to focus, caught his. “Are you afraid of death?”

He paused. “No.”

She grinned at him, her eyes closing as her consciousness began to drift away. She put one hand on his face, droplets of blood smearing across his cheek.

“You’re lying,” she said. And then she died.

## THE COWARD IN THE CASTLE

THEN

A phone is ringing.

Aaron Siegel stands outside of a church. Its walls, rotted and crumbling, strain to hold up the towering, pockmarked roof above it. One of the doors hangs loose on a single hinge, swaying softly in the wind. The windows, long since stripped of their panes and frames, whistle an eerie song as the wind slices through them. The entire structure creaks and groans.

A phone is ringing.

Aaron looks behind him. He can see Arians standing next to their car, watching him. Between the haze of the dust and the setting sun, he almost looks like a mirage. He’s too far away, and Aaron can’t make out his features. All he sees is his friend’s coat, whipping in the wind, and the dark glasses on his face.

A phone is ringing.

Aaron looks off in the distance, and sees fire. He hears the moaning and screeching of metal on metal, and sees smoke rising over the mountains.""")

A phone is ringing.

Aaron hears voices. Nine voices, calling to him from the earth. They know. They know he carries the trigger, and they ache for its release. They cry out to him, begging him for the elation of their own torment. They cannot hear each other, but they can hear him. Each footstep sends their tiny bodies writhing in their concrete tombs, their broken arms outstretched, grasping towards a god they cannot see. “Come back,” they say. “Make us whole again.”

A phone is ringing.

Aaron steps towards the church, but his gait is unsure and his pace wavers. Inside the church, he will find truth. The sky burns bright in the light of a blighted god. Horror seeps through the soil, wrapping tiny, shredded fingers around his shoes. He pulls away, and struggles towards the church. The sun sinks below the mountains, and as it does he sees a Red Right Hand hanging in the heavens. The wind knocks the doors of the church wide, and from within its ruined hall he hears the sound of a man laughing.

Inside the church, a phone is ringing.

NOW

“This is it?” Olivia said.

Calvin consulted the journal. The location was right, so far as he could tell, but the smoking ruin they had come upon was not the fortress described in the text. Shielding his eyes from the sun, he tried to make out some features noted by the author, but was unable to. As a whole, it was an unrecognizable mess.

“Yeah,” Calvin said slowly, “this is it.”

Adam squinted through the smoke that drifted towards them. “You think somebody else got here first?”

Anthony grunted. “Likely not. I can’t imagine the Overseers have made it public that their contract is broken.”

“One of ours, then?” the young man inquired.

Calvin shook his head.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “Delta was very specific. Nobody but us.”

“Well shit then, kids,” Olivia said, taking off down the rocky hill. “Let’s go have a look.”

The four of them followed the road down towards a gatehouse that set nearly a half mile off of the destroyed fortress on the mountain. Aside from the drifting smoke and debris being kicked up in the wind, there was no other movement in the entire complex. The gate stood open, and they passed through. The gatehouse sat unoccupied.

“Little on the nose, don’t you think?” Adam said, examining the structure as they walked up the long drive towards it. “Evil organization boss has an evil fortress in the mountains?”

Anthony barked out a laugh. “You haven’t met Baron Hoadley, then.”

“Baron Hoadley?” Olivia asked.

“O5-8,” Anthony replied. “He didn’t build this fortress because he wanted to intimidate people. He built it because he’s a coward.”

“You knew him?” Adam asked.

Anthony hesitated for a moment. “Knew of him, sure. I’ve never met him. A reputation can follow you, though, regardless of what circles you run in.”

They carried on, though Olivia studied Anthony closely as they did.

— - —

The damage to the exterior of the mountain fortress was only an appetizer compared to the feast of destruction within. Staircases were broken and inaccessible, the floor beneath them creaked and groaned and in some places gave way entirely to soot and ash. Long steel beams across the ceiling sagged from the heat, and the entire estate stunk of fire and flesh. Every so often they would pass by a corpse of some man, likely a personal guard of the Overseer, their bodies charred and their faces mutilated. Several of them were piled against the inside of a locked door. More lay flat on the ground, running from something in the rear of the building.

They descended the levels they could, until they reached a large room whose walls seemed to no longer exist. The roof above it had long since collapsed and smoke still floated out into the evening sky.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" There were guards in this room, too, though most of them were now superimposed against the walls, nothing more than the absence of a man where the heat couldn’t reach. They crossed the chamber, careful to avoid the corpses, the point from which the devastation seemed to have burst forth.

It was the corpse of a man, his body flayed open and his skin blackened. Something dull and metallic was anchored onto his exposed spine, and as they approached they could hear a gentle whirring of spinning gears. From within his chest grew a massive, scorched, flesh covered spire that branched out in all directions towards the ceiling. Large chunks of burnt meat sat rotting around the room. Anthony stooped down to study the figure.

“Yep,” he said, “that’s definitely the Overseer.”

“What the fuck happened here, then?” Adam said, incredulous.

“If I had to take a guess,” Anthony said, standing back up, “I think that Baron had enjoyed the benefits of some sort of… augmentations, or magic, or… something unnatural, which were kept in check because he couldn’t die.” He glanced around the room. “Judging by how far down the fires have burned, I’d guess that a few weeks ago he suddenly found himself very mortal, and his augmentations didn’t agree with each other.” He poked the spinning gear mechanism with his foot, causing it to spin a little faster. “Yeah, definitely didn’t agree with each other.”

Olivia peered down at the corpse. “That’s it, then? One more down?”

Calvin nodded as he surveyed the scene. “Everything here looks more or less self-contained. I guess… yeah, I mean, I guess we’re finished here.” He glanced at his watch. “It’s going to be late soon. Let’s find somewhere to bunk down, and we’ll leave in the morning.”

“So we’re standing alone on a beach, and our evac is five minutes away,” Calvin growled, his voice hushed as he gestured a spinning helicopter. “We’ve got Peacekeepers on the other side of this hill, and the rabid occultists sprinting down the beach.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" There’s a Foundation destroyer parked three miles off of the beach, you can barely see it, but we know that at any moment they could open up a railgun and turn us into a red smear on the sand.”

Adam rocked back and forth with giddy excitement. “So what did you do?”

Calvin made another grand gesture. “What do you think? I unclipped my rifle and mowed them down, every last one! All fire and hot lead and fury, until the beach was empty and our evac arrived.”

The young man’s eyes were nearly bright enough to illuminate the dark room. “Holy shit dude. Why haven’t you told me this before?”

“Because it’s bullshit,” Olivia said, walking into the room and setting down scavenged food from the kitchens. “What your glorious leader has failed to mention is that he had lost his gun before we ever got on the beach. He dropped it when one of the native kids threw a rock at him while we were riding down the main road about three towns away. In lieu of a Rambo-style shootout,” she said, smiling at Calvin as he simmered across the room, “I glamoured us up a big sea turtle and we hid underneath it until the Peacekeepers had moved on and the occultists got bored. Then we swam out to the sandbar where our rendezvous was waiting, in a fishing boat.” She poked a finger towards Calvin. “And I wouldn’t call that glorified dingy a Foundation destroyer. It was barely a patrol ship.”

“You know,” he said, glowering, “there’s something to be said about the victors getting to write history.”

“I know,” she said, grinning. “I just did.”

Adam laughed. “I didn’t realize you two had known each other so long. Have you worked together for a while?”

“A while!” Olivia spat. “How old do you think I am?”

Adam’s foot promptly ran itself a mile down his throat, and Olivia laughed again. “Yes,” she said, “it’s been a while. We first met… when? In Budapest? That would’ve been in ‘94?”

“Too long,” Calvin squawked, taking a drink from a metal flask.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “Ever since I had to pull her ass off the street when she was running with that group of art monkeys.”

“Excuse me,” she said, smacking the back of his hand with a wooden spoon. “Those ‘art monkeys’ were how I got my foot in the door here. The great Calvin Lucien would’ve had no interest in me if I couldn’t do magic.”

“I don’t have any interest in you now,” he said, earning himself another smack.

“Hang on, magic? Like, you’re a wizard?” Adam said with renewed awe. “How do I not know this?”

“I don’t make a habit out of talking about it in public,” Olivia said, stirring her soup, “but yes. Once upon a time I was The Incredible Ivory, an anartist of some renown. I worked a couple of shows in Paris and Munich before our cell got busted by Foundation thugs. We got scattered, and the Insurgency moved in to pick up the pieces.” She eyed Calvin again. “In Budapest.”

He shrugged. “I’ve cleaned up plenty of the Foundation’s messes in my day. They all sort of run together after a while.”

As another deft smack rang through the ruined hall they had made their camp in, Anthony shuffled around a corner holding a stack of books. He grunted as he tossed them to the ground in front of the group, and gave them a nudge with his foot.

“Alright. Homework time.”

Olivia scowled. “We haven’t even finished dinner yet. You don’t think we have time for a single night off? We haven’t stopped in weeks.”

Anthony grabbed a book off the top of the pile and settled into a large chair. “Suit yourself. But remember that the Overseers aren’t taking the night off.”

They each grudgingly picked up a book and began to flip through them. After quickly skimming a couple of pages, Adam paused.

“Anthony,” he said, “what about you? You’ve been around for a while, right?”

Anthony grunted a response.

“How long is that exactly?” Adam inquired.

Anthony sighed and sat the book down on the table next to his chair. “I have the distinct benefit of being the elder member of this group, by far.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" That’s all you need to know.”

Adam scowled. “Come on, man. We’ve been working together for months now and I feel like I don’t know anything about you.”

Calvin coughed. “He’s just mad because he doesn’t want to tell you how old he is.” He flipped a page. “Here’s a hint: it’s pretty old.”

Anthony glared at him. “At my age, kid, you don’t think so much about the things you’ve done, and start thinking more about the things you could’ve done.” He grunted. “That list is pretty long.”

“I mean, we all knew what we signed up for, right?” Adam said in between bites of a sandwich. “Our lives in service to a better world? Our lives as sacrifice in order to create a future for the rest of mankind?” He swallowed. “That doesn’t sound too bad.”

Anthony stared into his book. “You say that now. You’re young. The goal isn’t too far away from where you’re at now. When it’s done, you get to go back. But me, and some of the others… this is all it’s ever been. I knew what I signed up for, aye. You’re right in thinking we all did. I’m not ashamed of it. It’s just a bittersweet satisfaction you get from it.”

Calvin elbowed Adam. “Listen kid, don’t let him get you down. We’ll probably all be curmudgeons when we get to be as old as he is. But carrying on the Engineer’s legacy, standing in opposition to-”

Anthony snorted. “The Engineer. I’m sure.”

They all stopped and looked at the old man, who shook his head slowly. “Feel free to call it whatever you want, but don’t call it carrying on The Engineer’s legacy.”

Calvin raised a single eyebrow. “You have a better way to describe keeping the torch of our founder?”

Anthony put the book down again and closed his eyes. “The Engineer is a lie that Delta Command tells the Insurgency to keep everyone in line. ‘Do it for His Legacy,’ they say. No. Do it for your friends and family. Do it because it’s the right thing to do. But don’t do it for some asinine notion that you’re keeping up a man’s legacy.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

“What are you talking about?” Olivia said.

Anthony leaned back in his chair. “They’ll tell you a lot of things about The Engineer. Some of them are true. He certainly did build the Insurgency from almost nothing. He set forth many of its tenets. But he also turned traitor the moment he had a chance to grab power.”

Adam sat up quickly, and Calvin glared at the old man. “What are you even talking about?” he barked. “You act like you knew the man.”

He paused. “I did know him,” Anthony growled back. “I followed him during the Defection. I carried the weight of our young Insurgency right beside him, and I was left to pick up the pieces when he stabbed us in the back and bolted for the Foundation the moment he got a better deal - when they made him an Overseer.”

“That’s impossible,” Adam said slowly. “If you knew the Engineer, you would have to be… god, a hundred years old. Older even than that.”

Anthony didn’t move. “Yes,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “Older even than that.”

Calvin laughed mockingly. “Isn’t that something, then. Rail against the unnatural while dipping your hand in that same honeypot to extend your life.”

Anthony glowered at him. “I was a child. I knew nothing. I’ve grown up, but that shit doesn’t just leave you.”

“Who knows about this?” Olivia said quietly.

“Nobody.” Anthony rubbed his palm against his temple. “Nobody needs to. Everytime somebody became suspicious, I would disappear for a while and come back with a different name. Even then, in those times I would be gone, I wasn’t ever far away - just enough to snuff out suspicion while still doing what I could to protect our ambitions.”

Calvin threw up his hands. “So let me get this straight - you expect us to believe that you, someone who has anomalously extended their life past what is natural and who knews what else, you expect us to believe that you now know better than the Engineer? Everything we have here is owed to the Engineer, and the sacrifices he made.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Our entire doctrine is-”

“Sacrifices?!” Anthony was standing now, his face reddening. “You think he made sacrifices? He let others do the sacrificing for him. He lost nothing and gained everything he ever wanted, and we all fell for it. Well fell for it because we were idealists, Calvin. We believed we could singlehandedly stand against the darkness, that our actions would make a difference. The Engineer took that idealism, used it for as long as it was useful to him, and then broke its back!”

Adam moved to speak, but Anthony couldn't be deterred. "We built this Insurgency from the ground up, together, and we shared everything. He took that knowledge back to the Foundation and used it to ruin us. Hundreds were killed! Thousands! He knew everything there was to know about us, our facilities, our encampments, our storehouses. He knew it all, and he destroyed it all! We became a joke to them!"

He sunk back into his chair. “We set up Delta in the wake of his betrayal to be purposefully realistic. That's why the Insurgency has no real goal - the Summa Modus Operandi is the only goal, and until now it has been an unattainable one. This is by design. Give us something to do until an opportunity presents itself, or forever be the wriggling doubt in the back of his mind, if he's even still in there."

He paused to take a drink. His expression softened. He looked tired. "Delta doesn’t even know. It wouldn’t matter; even if they did, it benefits them to maintain the cult of personality based around him. He’s a mascot at this point, and one our organization needs desperately.”

“If what you’re saying is true,” Calvin said with measured words, “then why haven’t you said anything sooner?”

Anthony shrugged. “To what end? A chance that people believe me and lose faith in the Insurgency, or a greater chance they don’t believe me at all, like what you’re doing now. What difference would it make?” He paused. “Our goal is still the most important thing.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Anything that would distract from that goal cannot be allowed.”

“So why are you telling us now?” Olivia said softly.

Anthony didn’t speak right away. He brought a single finger up to his temple and began to rub it slowly, closing one eye and looking off somewhere in the distance. “I’m telling you now, because it matters to me that you know. It would be nothing short of a miracle for us all to make it through this.” He paused again. “It doesn’t seem right to let somebody die without knowing the truth of what they’re dying for. We do what we do because the natural order demands we correct our mistakes, not because of what some traitor said to do seventy years ago.”

He stood, book in hand, and began to walk away. “Find whatever peace you can in that.”

— - —

Later, after Olivia and Adam had fallen asleep by their stack of burning furniture, Calvin sat awake. He rolled a vial of liquid back and forth in his hand, his eyes fixed on it. The light of the fire danced across its surface, reds and yellows scattered across a field of sparkling blue. It was cool to the touch - it always had been - and holding it in his hand made him feel calm. He couldn't explain it, but there was something comforting about —

"Where did you get that, Calvin."

It wasn't voiced like a question. Calvin spun quickly to find Anthony standing a few paces behind him, face only partially illuminated by the light of the moon. Calvin tucked the vial into his pocket.

"It's none of your business," he said quietly.

Anthony snorted. "It absolutely is my business, because last I checked there wasn't any of it left." He came forward out of the dark and took a seat on the ground next to Calvin. He was whittling at a stick with a short knife. "Do you know what it is?"

Calvin nodded. "It's water from the Fountain of Life."

Anthony cocked his head, peering down at the end of his stick. "That it is. I imagine you have already used another vial to help bring poor Dr. Carter to a long-awaited grave.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""" Calvin nodded. "Yet here you are with another one. Now that is something, isn't it?"

He set the knife and stick down and leaned back against a chair. "When they ran the Fountain dry, there was just enough water left for twelve vials. Each of them had already drank from it and had their eternal youth assured, but these extra twelve vials were given to each of them - just in case. Last I had heard, they had all been consumed, but now you have two. I wonder whose you ended up with?" He paused. "What are you going to do with it?"

"Nothing," Calvin said quickly. "Destroy it, eventually."

Anthony closed his eyes. "Good. There is nothing in that bottle but poison, take my word for it. It'll clean up your wounds and restore your youth, but the life you lead afterwards is a shallow one - an empty one. You start to lose the taste of things, the color starts to come out of the sky."

"So you really have tasted the waters," Calvin said, something like incredulity betraying his words.

Anthony sighed. "Yes. When we defected, we took vials of water from the Fountain for ourselves. Not all of us, but a few. I was one of the lucky ones." He laughed. "Lucky. No, not lucky. Once I realized what it was that I had done, I spent years trying to find a way to undo it. The steps I've taken haven't brought back my taste or brightened my eyes, but they have made me start aging again. Slowly."

Calvin pulled the vial back out and looked at it for a moment. When he turned back to Anthony, the man was looking at him. "Back at the chateau, when Donna Taylor said you were lying about being afraid of death - what do you think she meant by that?" Anthony asked.

Calvin shrugged. "I don't know. I'm really not." He paused. "Or— well, I don't know. I'm not afraid of dying myself, but when I think about losing people, the ones I'm close to or the ones who look to me for guidance… something about that makes me feel sick."

"Of course it does," Anthony said, smiling.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" "There's nothing wrong with being afraid of death, Calvin. It's the great unknown - and the fear of losing people to it has driven greater men to worse evils. Trust me, even I have succumbed to that fear before." He stopped for a moment, staring now at the edge of his knife blade. "The difference between us and the Foundation is that we can accept death's role in the natural order - as we can accept the natural order for what it is. The Foundation contains these monsters and miracles and researches them in the hopes of finding greater truths - all for the benefit of the Overseers. They claim to want to keep the power of gods out of the wrong hands, so they keep it for themselves. We deny the power of the gods at all." He clicked his tongue against his teeth. "It shouldn't exist, Calvin. Not like this. Our world wasn't made to sustain it."

Anthony looked back down at the vial. "The decision is yours, Calvin, but if I were you I would destroy it and never think of it again, because I won't let you use it, and I don't want to kill you. I won't let you make the same mistake he made."

Calvin didn't look up at him. "You said you've come and gone over the years - that you've used different names. Who are you?"

Anthony smiled. "For you, right now, I'm Anthony Wright. I've been other people before, but all of those people died when I passed to the next name. The man I was when we defected hasn't been alive in decades."

With that, Anthony turned over onto his side and within moments was quietly snoring from under his jacket. Calvin persisted a while longer, until he too was taken by sleep.

The Incredibly Ivory flees down a dark alleyway in the Three Portlands, Foundation agents fast on her heels. She has run for what has felt like hours now, and knows she does not have much left to give. She hears dogs barking and her legs burn like cinders. She catches sight of another agent rounding the corner in front of her, so she stumbles down a side street.

It opens into a quiet intersection, but she can hear them approaching from all around her. Exhausted and resigned, she collapses in the street. Paint and blood are smeared on her clothes, and she laughs now seeing the mess. Well, she thinks, at least they'll give me something to change into.

Small white insects, those that haven't seen the light of day in a hundred generations, scurry for cover. The man lights his lantern and starts forward.

There's a draft from somewhere beyond this room, so he follows it. He ducks carefully under rock formations, tenderly brushing up against them so as to not disturb them.""")

He opens into another cavern, but before he can get his bearings his foot snags the edge of the walkway and he tumbles to the ground, his lantern dashing and shattering against the ground, spilling oil and fire out in every direction. He hurries to stand, rubbing his side where he'd struck hard stone. Before he can move to put the fire out, a miracle catches his eye. In front of him is a waterfall, small but dozens of feet high. He approaches it cautiously, extending a hand out into the waters which he now sees flow up and around his hand. He splashes the water, which continues to flow up and out of the pool at his feet, towards some point in the dark far above him.

In the dimming light of that cavern, standing before an impossibility, Frederick Williams grins.



NOW

Adam burst into a clearing, hands slapping at his face as he swerved and ducked away from a great many tiny assailants. Olivia wasn't far behind, followed closely by Calvin and Anthony. Of the four of them, Olivia had fared the best in the jungle. Calvin had slipped and fallen into quicksand, which now covered his lower half as if he was an ice-cream-man-cone. Anthony was drenched head to toe in sweat from the humidity, and he grumbled and fumed each step of the way at the fucking dogshit heat. Lastly, Adam had earned the attention of a swarm of bugs, which (to his telling) had now followed him for the better part of the last mile, since their car had broken down.

Calvin called a general halt to their progress to survey a map and some notes he had received from Delta. Of the seventh Overseer, the journal had been scant - she moves often - but Delta had been watching the movements of the one they called Green for weeks.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" True to the journal's description, she had moved more frequently than any of the others, often staying at a location for no more than a few days, at best. But here, deep in the heart of these forests, she was said to have been staying for over a month.

"I don't like it," Anthony had said, chewing on the end of a cigar. "This feels like a trap."

"Yeah," Adam had answered, "we don't actually know that she's there, either. We just know that we haven't seen her leave. There are plenty of ways she could've gotten out."

Calvin had stroked his beard at the thought, catching Olivia's eye from across the room before she quickly looked away. "You're right. This is profoundly sketchy. But if our sources are correct and she's where we think she is, we might not get another chance at this. We have to act now."

So it was, then, that they arrived in—

"Cambodia!" Anthony shouted, tearing yet another piece of his shirt away from his body. "Cambodia! Of all places. If the bugs don't kill you, the wretched heat will." He pulled out a fan and began to feverishly wave it in front of his face. "I have had enough of this part of the world for one lifetime. If I never have to spend another day in these god-awful jungles it won't have come soon enough."

Calvin surveyed their map, noting a nearby river as a landmark. "We're close now. Once we're in the city, we need to meet up with Vanderveer. He'll be here, in this bar. He has contacts that can get us where we need to go." He pulled a bandana out and started wrapping it around his face. "Put something up over your face - we need to stay as discreet as possible here." He stuck a finger out towards Adam and Anthony. "You two pasty-faces stick out."

Anthony grunted, but Adam whipped his head around, face red from sustained smacks. "Hang on, what now? Why do we need to hide our faces?"

Calvin tucked his map and the journal away. "Same reason the Overseer is here right now. Political unrest.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Vanderveer says there's an artifact of some kind being held by the local revolutionaries, and that Green has come in personally to treat with them and get it back."

Adam's face ran white. "Why is an Overseer coming to treat with revolutionaries?"

"Don't be fooled," Anthony said, slinging Adam's canister over his shoulder, "this isn't a diplomatic mission. Green gets off on this kind of shit. If she's here, that means something disastrous is about to happen."

After quickly cleaning themselves off and covering their faces, the four of them crept back into the brush in the direction of the nearby city.

— - —

Calvin slunk behind a wall as a group of rioters passed by him, torches illuminating the dark streets. Somewhere not far off, he could hear the sound of gunfire and car alarms, and the occasional loud boom of a tank as the government moved troops into the city. He waited until they were gone, and moved quickly towards the east. They had gotten separated early on after a mob had formed around a grocery they were passing by. Anthony had radioed in that he was fine and moving towards the target, and Olivia and Adam had met up a few blocks later.

Under the orange fabric of an awning he saw a single light illuminating a sign - Pedro's Place - and an open door. He slipped through it, and the sound of the streets faded behind him.

Pedro's Place had emptied out earlier in the day when a brick had come through one of the front windows, but a handful of patrons still sat at the bar. The broken glass had been swept into a small pile in the corner and left untouched. Calvin entered casually, not rising to meet any of the eyes that crossed the room in his direction. He found a seat near the back of the small room at a table in a far corner, and hunched down to hide his features. After a moment, the bartender came by his table.

"What you have?" the bartender said, in broken English.

Calvin knocked on the table twice, then twice again, then three times.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" "I'll have what he's having."

The bartender paused, then nodded and left. A few more moments passed, and then another man returned to the table with beers in each hand. This man was a stout individual with fiery red hair and a lit cigarette burning in the corner of his mouth. He took a seat across from Calvin sliding one of them across towards him.

"Cheers, Calvin," he said. "Drink up, we'll likely be dead in the morning."

Calvin grinned through his handkerchief, which he quickly removed. "Van," he said, "aren't you a sight for sore eyes."

Vanderveer shrugged. "Must be pretty sore, then." He took a drink. "Where's the rest of your band of merry men? I was promised a raiding party, not a single over-the-hill operative."

Calvin snorted. "We were separated. Anthony is moving ahead to the watch point, and Liv and the kid are on their way. We should meet them on our way out."

Vanderveer nodded. "Once they arrive, we'll need to move quickly. We won't have an abundance of time to act - if the riots dissipate, we've lost our opportunity. Our only cover right now is that the streets are full of looters, and we're just a handful of tourists."

They were interrupted by a barking dog outside which quickly faded into the hum of the background. Calvin took another drink. "What's going on out there?"

"Local politics," Vanderveer said. "Kervier came in and set up here a number of years ago and thoroughly fucked the water. They were doing what they usually do, you know - come in, set up, dig furiously and then wait until the Jailers come and force them out. Only this time, the Foundation didn't show up." He laughed. "You probably had a hand in that."

It was Calvin's turn to shrug as Vanderveer continued. "Anyway, there are three sides to this. On one hand you have the local officials, all of whom were receiving kickbacks from Kervier and are seen as having betrayed their countrymen.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Then you've got these folks - let's call them revolutionaries - who have been pushing to overthrow the government for a while. When the details of the Kervier deal came out, they decided it was their time to shine and rose up en masse. They're holed up down at the governor's manor, supposedly meeting with the local governor to reach some agreement. Fact is, they're only there so that Green can stoke them and disrupt the agreements, and send the country into civil war. Once it's properly destabilized, the Jailers can swoop in and raid the armory where they're keeping this thing they want to get their hands on so badly."

"Who are the people in the street?" Calvin asked.

"Rioters. They're all just unhappy with the government and while most of them probably align with the revolutionaries, not all of them do. Mostly they just want to riot. They're dissatisfied and angry and want to loot and pillage. They're the most dangerous of the three sides right now, because if their attitudes turn especially violent we could be swept up in it before we have time to get out of dodge."

The sound of the street outside grew louder for a moment as the door opened, and through it stepped a man and woman. Calvin nodded, and Vanderveer stood.

"Time to roll," the husky Irishman said. "For the Insurgency."

Calvin took his extended hand. "For the Insurgency."

Olivia and Adam fell in behind them, and together the four snuck quickly out of a concealed side door. As they passed the bartender, the man gave them a nervous nod. Once they were out on a side street, Vanderveer pointed towards lights in the distance.

"That's where we're going," he said, voice rising slightly to be heard over the din of the crowd. "The revolutionaries have set up there. To get inside we'll need to meet up with one of my contacts, Jo." He glanced down at his phone. "I was hoping to have heard from him by now, but there's really not much time to wait. Let's go.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""""

They took off in the direction of the governor's manor, sticking mostly to side streets to avoid the rioters and larger gatherings. As they paused to wait for a mob to pass, Calvin pulled out his radio and called Anthony.

"Anthony," he said, "do you read? Where are you?"

The radio crackled a response. "Made it to the watch point. There's a throng of ne'er-do-wells down here pillaging an electronics shop, so I've gone onto the roof. Where are you?"

"We're leaving Pedro's now. Any sign of our target?"

"Not yet. She should be pretty easy to spot, what with the jumpsuit and all." The radio was silent. "Be advised, Calvin - there are a lot of troops moving out of the manor now. They're keeping out of the main street here and I don't think anyone on the ground has noticed. If things turn sour here, I think they're going to break really badly."

Calvin took a deep breath. "Roger that. We'll meet you soon."

The four of them skirted past a burning shop and down a narrow street with a tight bend at the end. Approaching it, Vanderveer held up a hand and they stopped as he peered around the corner. He turned back and swore.

"Looters," he said. He pulled a sidearm from its holster. "Don't do anything stupid."

He sidled around the corner with the rest of them not far behind. As they approached the group of people emptying a store of its contents, one of the looters noticed them, and then they all did. Vanderveer sucked in his chest and smiled, extending his arms.

"Evenin' lads," he said with as much gusto as he could muster. "Just passing through, see. Don't want any trouble. Got money if you want it, no problems here."

One of the looters looks back towards the others, and then turned back towards the group, nodding. Vanderveer produced his wallet and stepped forward slowly, holding it out in front of him.

"There we go," he said, "nice and easy now."

Suddenly, bullets zipped through the group of looters and the men and women began falling over each other.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" One of them pulled a gun and began firing into the dark behind them, and then everyone had guns. Van turned to run back towards the other three, but a stray shot caught him in the leg and he collapsed, cursing. Calvin ran up to grab him as he fell, and the three of them started to pull him off the street. Vanderveer looked back towards the group of rioters, his eyes growing wide.

"Gas," he said, pointing. "Jailers."

A cloud of gas had formed over the bodies of the dead and dying looters, which crept towards the group. Out of the cloud emerged dark shapes with masks and rifles in riot armor. Even from the distance they were at, Calvin could make out the insignia on their shoulders. Nine-Tailed Fox.

"Oh shit," Adam said under his breath, and suddenly the group was in a near sprint, with Calvin heaving the hefty Vanderveer over his shoulder to keep up the pace. They darted down side streets, but no matter where they turned more armored shapes emerged from the shadows. They turned again, and found themselves in a dead end.

"Fuck!" Olivia said, turning back towards where a group of Foundation agents now stood at the entrance to the alley they had walked into. Vanderveer swung around on Calvin's shoulder, firing furiously at the agents. One of them collapsed, then another. A bullet pinged off one of their masks, and the agent disappeared behind the rest. Then, one near the front produced a thick steel canister, pulled a tab, and rolled it towards them. A thick, orange gas blew out of the can from both ends, filling the alley.

Calvin moved to run forward, but each step into the cloud felt like a thousand, and suddenly he was as heavy as lead. He heard Vanderveer swear as he fell from Calvin's shoulder, and then he heard Adam hit the ground, and then himself, and then the world went black.

        await ctx.channel.send(""" He reached as far backwards with his hands as he could, and he felt something cold but very alive - Olivia. Somewhere nearby, he heard the unmistakable sound of Adam snoring.

Then, a voice.

"Captain, captain, captain," it said, slowly and steadily. It was a rich voice, vaguely Southern, full-textured and hearty, and clearly female. The voice was that of someone very sure of where they stood. "I should start giving you menial scouting missions more often, when you come back with prizes like these."

Another voice, this time male. Harsh. "Are these the insurgents?"

"Yes, I believe they are," the woman said. Calvin heard footsteps, and then nothing. "This one is out of place. We're missing one."

"What would you like done with him?" the man said.

The woman paused, considering. "Well. No point in waking him, I think. All in all, a better way than what we have in store for the rest of them."

There was a heavier sound as the man - clearly in boots - crossed the room. Calvin heard the sound of a bullet sliding into its chamber, and then the ear-piercing pop of a gunshot. Calvin jumped, and heard Olivia scream from behind him.

"Look, look. They're awake. Get them up, hurry. We don't have a ton of time." More footsteps, and then Calvin was yanked upwards by two sets of hands. The hands pushed him against the wall and another pulled the blindfold off of his face.

He squinted against the glare of the lights, and as the room became clear he was met with the sight of a short, squat woman in a dark green pantsuit. She wasn't old - maybe early 50s, and she wore black shoes with green flowers on them. She was leaning down to look at him quizzically, like some bird of prey lurking over a meal. Calvin turned to his left and right, confirming that Olivia and Adam were there with him and generally no worse for wear. He glanced into the corner of the room and then back quickly - Vanderveer lay dead on the ground, a bullet hole placed between his eyes.""")

The door to the room cracked open. "What was that?" asked the voice on the other side. "Who you shooting?"

The woman in the pantsuit waved them off. "Don't worry about that. I'm dealing with a personal issue. You understand? Personal. P-E-R-S-O-N-A-L. That means no you. Scooch."

The door slid closed, and she turned back towards the group, smiling.

"Well well well," she said, clapping her hands together. "And here I thought I was going to have to spend time looking for you three, and you walk right into one of my patrols. That's just something, I tell you what."

Noticing that Olivia was staring at Vanderveer, the woman gestured dismissively. "Oh, don't you worry about him, sug. He went quick and easy. You're about to have a harder time of it, I'm afraid."

She turned back towards an open window. From outside, they could hear the sound of the throng of revolutionaries in the street.

"Introductions! Where are my manners, goodness. My mama would've whooped me for that. My name is unimportant - you can just call me Green. Everybody does, hell, you probably do too. As for you three," she paused, finger held against the side of her face, "the skinny one here is a runaway D-Class, the skinny bitch is the anartist who got away, and you - why, you're Calvin Lucien, aren't you? Tired of lobbing grenades at unarmed convoys, you've decided to step up to the big leagues and have a crack at some Overseers."

She laughed, a warm, wholesome laugh. "I've got to hand it to you Calvin, you've got some balls. I don't know what's in the water wherever you're from, but it's some pretty potent stuff. Some of my own could use a tall glass of it!"

Green turned back towards the window. "Now I know what you're here to do - hell, we all do by now. Some of my fellows decided to turn tail and run for their holes after that little stunt you pulled with poor ole Felix - very clever, by the way. You know what's funny is that Felix himself had worried about that, a long time ago.""")

The Foundation doesn't run by itself, and it certainly doesn't run if there's nobody telling it to go. Besides," she turned her head to look back at them, her eyes steely and her smile crooked and devilish, "this is the most alive I've felt in years."

Calvin grunted. "You're a peach."

Green laughed again. "Georgia grown! Isn't that fitting?" She crossed the room again in a hurry. "So here's what I'm going to offer you, Calvin - something of a wager. Have you ever watched a fly at a flytrap? That's the most natural gamble out there. The fly is gambling that it can make it down to that sweet, sweet nectar and out before the flytrap snaps shut. The fly is willing to take that bet, though, because the nectar is so good and it's right there."

She pointed at Adam and Olivia. "I'm going to offer you lives, for a life. Easy. You let me kill one of the two of them - your choice, I'm not unfair - and I let you do whatever you want to me. Kill, maim, butcher, whatever. OR, and here's where it gets interesting, you refuse and I leave this room, go into that room," she pointed a pudgy finger at the door that had opened earlier, "and put a bullet into the neck of Ying Ko-something or other, the revolutionary leader. You and your two friends here might make it out alive, but as soon as that throng in the street find out their golden boy was gunned down by the troops now firing on them they'll set the whole countryside alight."

Green squatted down in from of him, both hands held out in front of her. "That's where it is, Calvin. There's the nectar. It's right there. All you have to do is reach out and take it."

The woman laughed. "She's right, Calvin. Somebody is dying tonight, and you get to decide who. Come on now, we don't have all night. Ping Pong is not a patient man." She motioned at him, and the guards sat him back up.

"Fine," Calvin said, spitting out blood, "shoot me. Let those two go."

Green didn't laugh, but her smile grew unnaturally wide. "No no, Calvin. That's not how the game is played. You don't get to choose yourself. You think this is some kind of noble sacrifice you'd be making?" Now she laughed. "You would've thought after so many years of losing, the Insurgency would've figured this out by now. There are no noble sacrifices, Calvin. Here's what will happen - you will choose one of your friends or those people out there and I live or I die. If I live, I go back to work and we replace the Overseers you've killed - it certainly wouldn't be the first time. If I die, you get to feel like you've won something for a moment, and then you are either killed by the masses outside those doors or killed by our agents or die of the flu or whatever. Maybe you kill another Overseer - Jean is looking wobbly right now, he'd be a good target. Either way, eventually you reach a point where you have exhausted your efforts, and then you'll stop trying. You'll run into a mountain you can't climb - and believe me, that mountain is coming up soon. You'll realize that this tower was built to not be climbed, and you'll give up. As soon as you give up, none of the deaths mean anything. It doesn't matter if it's you, or her, or me."

You think that killing people will stop the Foundation and, well," she paused, pensively. "You should ask Aaron Siegel about that. Hard to kill an idea."

She turned the hand back over. "Last chance. Make a choice, fly."

Calvin struggled against his restraints for a second more, and Green sighed. "Fine. You know, this is actually what I wanted in the first place anyway." She gestured at the captain, who strode towards the door. Olivia shouted out and lunged towards him, but was rebuked by the end of his rifle. He kicked the door open, and fired three times through the doorway. There was shouting on the other side, and then he fired again until the shouting stopped. He nodded to someone in the room, and walked through followed by the other agents. They heard another door open in the next room, and the sound of something wet and heavy hitting concrete.

The crowd outside went silent. A moment later there was a single gunshot, and then a thousand. The mob erupted, and the earth began to shake. More gunshots filled the air, and they could smell the distinct scent of gunpowder and searing flesh. Green turned to gather her things.

"You know that thing I said earlier, about flytraps? Here's what's funny about that - even if they don't go for the nectar, it's too late. They won't ever get out. The fly is made to do all sorts of things, but the flytrap? The flytrap is just there to catch the fly. But they keep coming, because that nectar sure does look good." She turned to look at them.

"Run." It was Anthony.

Adam snagged a key off the table as Green ran out of the room. Once unshackled, Calvin collected their weapons and the radio.

"Anthony," he said, running into the next room, "do you have eyes? Where's she at?"

"On the roof," Anthony said, "there's a helicopter landing right now. I'm heading your way."

As they rounded the corner, three of the revolutionaries stormed up the stairs, guns drawn. They opened fire on the three, forcing Calvin behind a table and Olivia back into the first room. Calvin returned fire, catching the first man in the shoulder and forcing him back. Olivia fired blind, but missed. Two more were coming up the stairs behind them, and more could be heard below. Calvin could barely hear the crowd below them over the din of the helicopter above.

Calvin reloaded, but out of the corner of his eye he saw Adam sprinting around the corner behind Olivia, something long and slender in his hand. Before Calvin could shout out to him, Adam had the Spear of the Non-Believer cocked back and aimed at the men in the stairwell. In the moment before he loosed it, Calvin felt the air get sucked out of the room. Silence filled the space where noise had been a second prior, and the lights dimmed. He grabbed his chest, unable to breathe, and managed to get turned just enough to look over the table towards the stairwell.

As it passed through them, they burst into flames and were quickly reduced to ash - the last sound from their lips being the faint whisper of a scream before being silenced forever. Calvin stood up unsteadily, his expression covered with disbelief. Adam stumbled backwards, bracing first against the wall and then Olivia as she came in behind him to scoop him up. He ran a hand through his hair, eyes wide and mouth hanging open.

"Holy shit," he said quietly, "I don't know what I was expecting, but… oh god."

"No time, come on," Calvin said before realizing that Adam could barely stand. "Olivia, stay here with him. Anthony will be up soon, I'll get Green."

Olivia nodded. Calvin bounded up the stairs towards the roof, taking the door with a lowered shoulder and bowling out onto the platform above. The helicopter was just a few steps away, and Green was standing on the railing. When she saw him, she extended her free hand in greeting.

"This is it, Calvin!" her voice cut over the sound of the helicopter and the crowd below, which was now in a frenzy. Fires had broken out across the entire quad, with more cropping up in the distance as the city began to burn. "This is the world your actions lead you to. I hope it was worth it!"

Calvin pulled out his sidearm and fired at her. He missed once, then twice, and then an explosion rocked the building and his gun fell from his hand. He reached to grab it but was too slow, and it disappeared over the edge of the roof. With Green laughing over the noise, the helicopter began to ascend.

"Ah, Vince, you were late! I had hoped I'd get the chance to catch up with you too!" She blew him a big kiss. "I'll tell Aaron you said hi when I see him next!"

Then, something streaked out of the crowd below them - a rocket. It arced into the sky and disappeared into the open door of the helicopter. For a moment nothing happened - Green didn’t look like she’d even seen it. Then, scarlet filled the sky as the rocket and helicopter both burst into flames and fell to the earth. The blades were spun out into the crowd, and the flaming mass of metal struck a nearby building. The fuel exploded, and both the wreckage and the building collapsed into the crowd below them.

Another explosion rocked the ground beneath them, and then another. Overhead, low-flying shapes came into view, moving quickly past them and away into the distance. Moments later, fire lit up the horizon, drawing closer to them. Another wave of shapes passed by - jets - and then more fire. One of them struck the street outside the governor's manor, causing Calvin to stumble. Anthony caught him by the jacket and pulled him to his feet.

"Time to go, kid," he said.

They sprinted to the rooftop access and down the stairs where Adam and Olivia were waiting. Motioning for them to follow, Anthony led them down another stairwell into the kitchens. They danced around falling pots and pans as more explosions sent shockwaves through the walls of the manor, the mortar and brick beginning to give way in places as the ceiling above them cracked and splintered. They turned one corner, and then another, and then a third led them to a side door that Anthony lowered a shoulder into, flinging it open and emptying them out onto the street.

He was cut short by the scream of something unnatural. Turning back towards the flaming wreck of the building next to the manor, they saw a fiery figure step out of the wreckage. Its skin had sloughed off half of its face, and one arm had been severed just above the elbow. It stumbled out into the street, trying to balance on rapidly melting legs. Its eyes were gone entirely; all that remained were empty sockets full of smoke.

The figure turned towards them and opened its mouth, and a foul moan echoed out of its charred throat, drowning out all sounds around them. It took one step towards them, and then another. Instinctively Calvin fired at it, and the bullet tore through flesh and bone but still it inched forward. The figure moaned again and raised its hand, leveling a gun at Calvin's chest. He realized too late what it was, but by the time he heard the crack of the gunshot he was already on the ground.

Standing over him was Anthony, hand clutching the side of his neck. Another crack, and he stumbled backwards as Olivia screamed and fired back. Blood was pooling underneath his shirt. There was a third crack and the sound of a bullet ricocheting off the pavement as the holder of the gun collapsed into a smoking, smoldering, unmoving pile. Anthony turned as if to walk away and fell, only barely avoiding slamming into the pavement as Adam slid underneath him to break his fall. Calvin scrambled to his feet and rushed over.

The helplessness of it all began to close around him like a shroud.

Then he felt something - a weight that he had forgotten about and suddenly remembered. He reached into his jacket and pulled out a crystal vial of clear, shimmering fluid. He held it in front of him, the light of the fires behind them dancing across its surface like fireworks in rain. Adam saw it too, and his eyes drew wide. Olivia had stopped what she was doing, and then they were all watching Calvin. Almost unconsciously, he brought his other hand up to remove the seal.

"No!" croaked Anthony through spittle and blood. "Calvin- no. No. Don't."

Olivia looked back down at him, tears streaming down her face. "Anthony, please. Please, we can save you, we can-"

The older man shook his head. "No- not like that. No." His eyes, which had until this moment been unfocused, were now locked onto Calvin's. "My mistake. Mine. Not yours."

Calvin hesitated, his hand still inches from the seal of the vial. Then, as quickly as he had produced it, he slid it away into his jacket.

Anthony sighed. "Vincent-" he whispered, his voice hoarse and barely audible over the din, "-Arians. It was my name." He raised a hand towards Calvin, who took it into his own. "Here, now, for you- Anthony." He smiled.

Then, after one more shallow breath, Anthony Wright died.

Calvin was the first to stand. He took several deep breaths, trying desperately not to think about it.

"We need to go," he said. "The car pool, he said there were cars. We need to get out of here."

Adam looked up, his eyes red behind tears. "We can't leave him here. We can't.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""" He turned to Olivia as if to beg her, but she was already frantically digging around in her bag. After a second, she pulled out a thin brush and a small container of light blue paint. She motioned for Adam to stand back, and the young man took two hesitant steps away from Anthony's body.

With a swift, deft hand, she ran long lines of paint across the body. At the spots where the lines intersected, light shined through the color of the paint as if from underneath it. She ran several more lines, and then more crossing over those, and then stepped back. Anthony's body was covered in many thin lines of glowing blue paint, which blinked and pulsed slowly. She leaned forward over him, and leaned down to kiss him on the forehead.

Like lightning, the lines all lit up at once. Each of the individual cells created by the crossing lined began to change until they were cloudy and opaque, as if he was covered in many pieces of stained glass. As they all solidified into a glass cocoon around the body, Olivia brought the other end of her brush down into the center of the figure, shattering it. The glass collapsed, and suddenly the air was filled with a prismatic cloud of crystal butterflies, each sounding a single note of a song that played around them over the chaos of the fighting beyond. They swung around the group once, and then away from them into the air. The glass was no more, and Anthony's body was gone.

Calvin grabbed the two of them up, and together they raced down the alley towards the back of the manor. More explosions lit up the night sky, and dark figures raced into the woods outside the city all around them. When they reached the car lot, half of the vehicles there were on fire and a ten meter crater was carved out of the ground where they had been. The scrambled through an open gate and surveyed the scene.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

"Shit," Olivia said, "what are we going to do?"

Without warning, a military jeep came around the corner from behind a patch of trees, stopping in front of them. The door opened and a man climbed out, his features hidden beneath a hood and bandanna.

"Take the car," the man said, "drive north until you are out of the country. A map in the glove box will take you to your next contact." He looked back towards the flaming city behind them. "Is the Overseer dead?"

Calvin nodded.

The man didn't move. "And Wright?"

None of them responded. The man paused, and then handed a pack to Calvin. "This is food, water, and munitions to last you until you reach the checkpoint. You must hurry - the Overseers have their kill squads roaming the countryside looking for you."

He took a few steps towards the treeline, and then turned back. "For the Insurgency."

"For the Insurgency," Calvin echoed.

The man disappeared into the trees, and the three of them climbed into the jeep. As another bomb dropped nearby, they tore out of the lot and onto a dirt road heading north into the dark forest.

Caucasian male. Spanish ancestry. Appears to be in his mid-fifties. The least subtle member of the Council, O5-6 is former American Union Brigadier General Rufus King. After fighting for the North in the American Civil War, O5-6 was appointed as Minister to the Papal States. Believed to have first met the individual called The Administrator while in Rome. The source of his longevity prior to the supposed deal with Death Itself is unknown, and if the current understanding of the Council is correct, then despite his appearance he is by far its oldest member.

O5-6 is believed to have founded the first Mobile Task Force, Alpha-1 "Red Right Hand", whose original purpose was strictly to find and destroy members of the fledgling Chaos Insurgency after their formation. Since then, he has administered all matters of the Foundation's executive arm, the Department of Applied Influence, encompassing all tasks forces, naval groups, and air superiority groups. While not originally advocating for its formation, O5-6 supposedly drew up the original organizational information for MTF Omega-7 "Pandora's Box" at the behest of General Bowe.

Has gone by several different names within modern military circles, and is believed to have held an office at the Pentagon since its construction. His standing within the American military is unknown, though at least three major sources have confirmed that many military leaders consider his authority second only to the sitting United States President, and several believe he supersedes it.

Arians stood in the doorway, slowly pulling on a cigarette. Aaron was sitting at a table a few feet away, flipping through a report they had received the day before. Outside the window of their makeshift command center in Guadalajara a parade danced through the street, slowly working its way towards the center of town.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The window was left open for the faint breeze, but it hadn’t helped.

Arians took another drag, letting the smoke fall out of his nostrils as he exhaled. He stepped inside and closed the door behind him. “I don’t know what you were expecting. Didn’t this confirm everything else we’ve heard so far?”

Aaron shook his head. “Yes, yes, it did, but I don’t understand it. They mobilized an army to La Paz - how is that possible?” He flipped the report over, looking for loose pages. “What we did in San Marco should have ruined them, Vince. Who was left afterwards?”

“Plenty of people were left - what do you mean?”

Aaron threw him a look. “I mean, who was left in command positions? Who knew how to- did any of them even know how to get into Site-01?” He tossed the report onto the couch behind him. “We didn’t leave the door unlocked, did we? Who was left?”

Arians shrugged. “Ansel Shaw, maybe. Last we heard he was operating out of that site in Michigan, but it could’ve been him. He wouldn’t know how to get into the secure site, though.” He paused, considering. “Skitter Marshall? Where was his team assigned?”

Aaron rubbed his eyes. “No, no, it wasn’t Marshall. He defected too - just not with us.”

They sat in silence for a moment longer, only the sound of the parade moving into the distance breaking the quiet between them. Then, without warning, the door to the room opened. Arians was at it in an instant, gun drawn. Aaron didn’t move, but stared unbelievingly at the figure inside the doorframe.

“Sophia?” he asked incredulously.

Sophia Light stepped through the door, slowly pulling a hood down off her face. Her hair was shorter than when they had last seen each other, but her eyes were the same unmistakeable green. Aaron felt something catch in his chest - something he hadn’t felt in years. Longing.

“No,” Arians growled, “a Foundation spy.”

Sophia rolled her eyes. “Put the gun down, you idiot. I’m not here to kill you.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""” She rolled up the sleeves of her gloves, revealing holes in both of her wrists that had long since scarred over, but not closed. She had no hidden weapons. “There, satisfied?”

“What are you doing here?” Aaron asked.

She pulled the coat off and set it on the single bed in the room. “You sent a message to Edward Bishop,” she said, looking at Aaron. “O5-13. All the same melodramatic prose as ever, I knew it was you. He added it to the file we have in place for the-” she paused, “the Children. See, Edward still believes the lie we’ve been telling everyone.”

“And what’s what?” Arians asked.

“That he, or any of us, are still in control.” She sat down across from them and lit a cigarette of her own. Aaron could feel his heart crashing against his chest. “Your Defection really did a number on us, boys. Scattered, leaderless, all of our best and brightest killed or gone into hiding. We threw together a hodgepodge of doctors and called them “Overseers”, but none of them are actually running the show.” She paused. “Not even me.”

Aaron frowned. “Then who is?”

“We don’t know,” she continued. “For years, the Overseers have been running the individual sites by themselves, but orders keep coming down from Site-01. Somebody is in there. For a long time we thought it was you,” she looked at Aaron, and her gaze softened slightly, “but after a while we realized it had to be something else entirely.”

She leaned back and closed her eyes. “I know you went back. I was following you. You saw exactly what I saw when I went back - a man-shaped absence where Frederick-” hearing her say his name made Aaron wince “-used to be. Smoke on a wall, and nothing else.” She took another draw on the cigarette. “So if you’re not in there, and he’s not in there, then who is calling the shots?”

Arians finally lowered his gun. “Why are you here?”

She glared at him. “Because the other day we found something that shouldn’t have been possible.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Site-19, the facility we built when we scrapped the plans for the Alaska site, there was a door there we hadn’t seen before. There was a whole new wing behind it, something that couldn’t have been built without us knowing.” She swallowed hard. “In that wing is a room with a statue in it. We didn’t put it there. We have no records of it being put there. We checked the file, and it just says that it was “moved there”. There wasn’t a file before. The date on that file changes every year - and that statue is one of the most horrible things I’ve ever seen.”

She stood up. “I’m here because something is happening at Site-01 that is changing the Foundation. New facilities are being built every day, more and more doctors and researchers are being recruited that we know nothing about. You saw what happened in La Paz?” They both nodded. “Those orders didn’t come from any of the Overseers. They came from Site-01. Somebody in there is making calls and the Foundation is following orders.”

She paused. “I don’t agree with what you did, and I think the Foundation has more to offer than you give it credit for, but what’s happening here needs to be stopped. We need to know what’s going on in there, before it’s too late.”

“Then why not just go?” Arians grunted at her.

She looked at him for a second, and then away to the ground. “I don’t want to go alone.”

Aaron and Arians exchanged glances. “If we find something in there,” Aaron said, slowly, “we’re going to kill it. You understand? The Foundation can’t be allowed to continue like this. Sophia - the damage it’s doing is- is more than we can keep up with. We’ve been looking at the numbers again, the ones we uh-” he laughed nervously, “-the ones we borrowed from Dr. Shaw, and his figures match our own. The Foundation is destabilizing our reality, Sophia. Williams was right about the threads, but they’re being damaged. We have to do something to stop this.” He met her gaze as she looked back up at him.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “I know we’re scientists, but this… this is a box we never should have opened.”

She opened her mouth to speak, but stopped and sighed. She nodded. “Fine. Get me in there and you can do whatever you feel like you need to do.”

Arians nodded. "I'll go radio headquarters. We'll need some kind of distraction to keep them off our backs while we take Site-01."

He put out his cigarette on the wall and left the room, closing the door behind him. Sophia watched him leave, and once he was gone turned her eyes back to her hands. Aaron didn't move.

"I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again," he said softly.

She smiled an uncertain half-smile, her eyes betraying her. "Well, yes. I wasn't sure either." She looked up at him, and Aaron could see that great sadness behind the facade of content. "It's difficult, you know. I lost everything that night: my friends, my mentor, my life's work. And you." She bit her lip until it was white. "I didn't know where to go. You left me and I was alone to pick up the pieces of what we had, and-"

Her voice trembled. "I don't want to know why you killed Frederick. I don't care. Maybe you knew something you didn't tell anyone but I don't know why you didn't tell me."

Aaron's face went pale. "I did want to tell you. I was preparing for- for what we were planning, and I told Vince to let everyone know." He leaned forward. "He didn't tell you?"

She grimaced. "No. He didn't. But neither did you. You had every opportunity to reach out to me, you knew all the channels, but you did nothing. It's been thirty years, Aaron. Thirty years and I hear nothing, not even word that you're still alive." A tear formed at the corner of her eye, and with the back of a glove she wiped it away. "When I saw you and Vince in San Marco, I thought I was seeing a ghost."

"I'm sorry," Aaron said softly. "I thought you had rejected the offer, that-"

"I would have rejected the offer," she said, her voice congealing into something venomous.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" "I dedicated my life to the Foundation and that project and you were all too willing to throw it away. Everything we'd worked for. All of our efforts."

Aaron slumped back in his seat. "Williams was-"

"I know what he was," she spat, "but he could have been dealt with. When you killed him and broke off to go gallivanting around the country shooting up convoys and stealing from warehouses, you threatened all of the work we had done. Do you remember why we did it? Do you even care? Our world is sick, and if we can't find the source of it then we're going to keep seeing-"

"The world was sick because of Williams," Aaron said pointedly, "he was the source, he was-"

"But here we are, thirty years removed from Frederick Williams' life, and you know what's happening out there?" She paused to light another cigarette. "More unexplained events every day. More artifacts and monsters we pull out of the ground, every day. Why, if the Administrator was the source of the anomalies, are we still seeing anomalies, Aaron?"

Aaron didn't answer. She sighed and sat back further on the bed, pulling her legs up to her chest. "I might have believed you back then," she said quietly. "I might have listened, but I have seen nothing in the last few decades that would lead me to believe that one man was the advent of every paranormal event in that time. There's something deeper out there, and it's not going to be stopped by killing a man. It's going to be stopped by research and investigation, and the only group with the resources to make that happen right now is the Foundation."

Aaron didn't respond. He sat, eyes downcast, as Sophia finished her cigarette.

"I'm not going to stop you from doing whatever you think you need to do," she said, her voice empty. "But before you do anything, you need to think about what it is you actually want."

She looked back towards the door. "And if it's what he wants, too.""")

NOW

— - —

They drove overnight, Olivia and Calvin taking turns at the wheel while Adam slept in the back seat. They didn’t say a word until they reached their destination - a small inn in a tiny town on the edge of the jungle, a few miles from the main road. They pulled off and parked at a petrol station and Calvin went inside the inn to meet their contact. It was morning, the sun had not quite risen, and they were exhausted.

The agent they had met in the burning city had given them not just a map, but a key and a notecard with a room number on it. Calvin entered and climbed the stairs to the second level and found the door that matched the card. Quietly, as to not disturb anyone else who might be listening for him, he unlocked the door and crept inside.

A thin stream of light from a streetlamp outside had eased its way between the thin blinds on the window, but otherwise the room was dark. Calvin closed the door behind him and took a few tentative steps into the room. He paused mid-step when he heard the distinctive click of a readied firearm.

“Does the Black Moon howl?” the voice behind the gun said.

“It is the only thing that howls,” Calvin replied.

A small desk light clicked on next to a cot against the wall. Sitting in the chair was Kowalski, gun in hand, a thin bead of sweat having very recently eagerly formed on his forehead. He sighed when he realized it was Calvin.

“Thank God,” he said, wiping his brow. “I don’t know if I could shoot someone if I had to. Targets, sure, but a person?” He grimaced. “It’s good to see you, Calvin.”

Calvin did a double take. “Kowalski? What are you of all people doing here right now? Was there nobody else you could send?”

The portly man frowned. “You know, I was an agent once too. It may have been a few years but I could still probably get the job done.” He pulled at his shirt slightly and uncomfortably, aware that they both knew that was a lie. “But no, I’m here because there’s something you need to know.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Our sources have indicated that American troops are landing on a beach near where you just came from. Ostensibly they’re here to quell the rebellion, but the numbers don’t seem to match their intentions.”

Something clicked in Calvin’s brain. “The jets. We saw bombers last night.”

Kowalski nodded. “They were coming from the Gerald R. Ford, who is anchored a mile off-shore. Something else you should know,” he continued, “is that there’s another ship in that group that doesn’t match any other US Navy ship on record. It’s flying an American flag but our sources believe it might be a Foundation destroyer - maybe the Scranton or the Wormwood. Either way, that probably means only one thing.”

Calvin nodded. “The Sixth Overseer.”

Kowalski nodded as well. “They’re going to try and smoke you out, Calvin. We can get you out of here if you want to get out, but…” he grimaced again.

Calvin knew why. The American was maybe the most well-known of the Overseers but arguably the hardest to get near. His involvement within the US military had no doubt led to its explosion in size and technological achievement over time, and in return the military acted like a steel curtain around him. Away from the United States he was at least vulnerable, even if he had brought an army with him. It was their only opportunity.

“What you’ve done so far has been nothing short of incredible, Calvin,” Kowalski said, leaning back in his chair. “I never would have though- we never would have thought anyone would get this close, but this one is different. There’s nothing clever you can do here. This is a hammer, and you are the nail.”

Calvin frowned. “Appreciate the vote of confidence.”

“I’m serious,” Kowalski said, and suddenly Calvin noticed something different about him - some quality that hadn’t been there before. Something stern and authoritative. “You’ve done amazing work but you need to keep doing amazing work. We might get a shot at this one later, after you’ve finished the others.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Maybe that will help. But right now, you’re three people in a jeep in southeast Asia, and you have an American military division a few hours away.” He sighed. “You’re no good to us dead.”

Calvin hesitated for a moment, considering what Kowalski had just said. Before he could make up his mind, the other man continued.

“There’s one more thing, Calvin. We have agents who have evidence of a secure container being moved out of Site-19 and onto that ship. Whatever is in there, they’re no doubt planning on weaponizing it.”

“If you were me, what would you do?” Calvin said.

Kowalski laughed. “Fortunately for both of us, I’m not you, because I wouldn’t be here right now.” He paused. “Here’s the way I see it. You’ve got no chance in a head-to-head anything. You’re outnumbered 3000-to-1, and that’s generous. Honestly, I don’t know if you’ve got a chance being sneaky, either. This army has spent the last four decades rooting people out of holes in the Middle East, there’s not a chance you wouldn’t be found.”

He paused again. “You know, I met O5-6 once, back before I joined Delta, at a government function. I don’t know if he knew who I was, but if he did he didn’t act it. I don’t know if there’s a more arrogant and braggadocious person in the entire world. The way he talks, he was the man who singlehandedly built the most powerful military in the entire world.” He laughed. “Maybe he did, I don’t know. I don’t think you win here by being smart, Calvin. I think you win by forcing him to do something stupid.”

Calvin nodded. “Maybe. Either way, I don’t see a way we can leave. We’re not going to get the shot again, and everything we do after this becomes that much harder if we don’t eliminate him.”

Kowalski stood up. “I agree. I don’t envy the position you’re in, but I don’t know of anyone more qualified than you to be in it.”

The two of them walked for the door, with Calvin opening it slowly. After catching a look from Kowalski, he shrugged sheepishly.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “Don’t want to wake anyone up.”

Kowalski laughed. “Oh, no, you won’t. This whole town is empty. They caught wind of what was coming and abandoned their homes last night.”

As they stepped outside the inn, the sun was just beginning to come up over the top of the trees, and a thin fog hung in the air. Adam was awake, sitting in the back seat of the jeep and running his hand over the metal canister that the Spear was in. When Olivia came around the car and saw them, she did an abrupt double take.

“Delta?” she said. “What are you doing here?”

“Delivering bad news, I’m afraid.” Kowalski looked back at Calvin, his eyes morose. “Do be careful, Calvin. You’re so close now.”

Without another word, Kowalski turned and began walking down the dirt road. He continued on until he was out of sight. Olivia turned to Calvin. “What did he mean?”

Calvin grimaced. “The Sixth Overseer is sometimes called The American. He’s an old Union general, one of those ghosts from long ago that just refuses to die. He’s also really easy to find - he’s got an office in the Pentagon.”

“So what’s the bad news?”

“The bad news is that he’s nearby, not far from here.”

Olivia shrugged. “That doesn’t sound bad. We don’t have far to go.”

Calvin gestured with uncertainty. “Not quite. Kowalski says he brought an American army with him. They landed on the beach back in the city and chances are they’re moving inland looking for us.”

Adam was listening now. “How many is in an army?”

Calvin considered. “About ten-thousand men in a division. They’ll have naval and air support, too. The jets we saw last night were probably US planes.” He crouched down, looking at a rock next to his shoe. “I’m all ears if either of you have any ideas.”

“What did the Delta say?” Adam asked.

Calvin snorted. “That he’s an asshole. Shocking, I know, for a guy who doesn’t go anywhere without an invading force behind him.” He sighed. “Either way, we need to put some room between us and them.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The way I see it, if we can head further north we might find a spot we can post up on for the night and see what they do next.”

They agreed, and together the three of them loaded into the jeep and followed the winding dirt road towards the hills in the north. For a while they could still see smoke rising in the far distance over the trees, but as clouds gathered above them and the rains began to fall the world behind them faded into the same shade of mottled grey. The road quickly morphed from something traversable to a muddy, impossible bog. They drove for hours, stopping only once to refuel from a nearly empty tank at an abandoned roadside shop. Day turned to night, and eventually the road turned into a gravel path leading up into the mountains.

They reached a short outcropping from which they could see for several miles over the trees, and backed the jeep into a small grove of trees. Sufficiently satisfied that it was not visible from the road below, they retreated below a rocky overhang to stay out of the rain. Calvin posted up for first watch, and the three of them traded shifts throughout the night.

— - —

Dawn broke on Olivia’s watch and the three of them collectively broke their meager camp. The rain had subsided but only just, and the skies were still cloudy and grey. While Calvin finished packing, Adam stood on the edge of the cliff, quietly fuming at the sky.

“Something up there piss you off?” Olivia asked, passing by him with a rolled bedding pad under her arm.

Adam shook his head. “I hate cloudy weather. This is bullshit.” He stared at the clouds a little longer, and then slunk off to his computer in the back of the jeep. Olivia shot Calvin a look, and Calvin rolled his eyes.

In the distance they heard a crack, and then another. There began a rumbling somewhere in the jungle, and from their perch they could see trees collapsing and the smoke of engines as something began to push through the trees. Calvin swore, and then looked into the sky.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Dipping just beneath the clouds was a flying thing, white and metallic, that disappeared back into the overcast as quickly as it had appeared. A drone.

“Alright, well, time to go,” he said, leaping into the jeep. “Looks like the party found us.”

They came skipping down off the outcropping and back onto the soaked and sloppy road towards the north. As they pulled away, a hulking metal shape came through the trees a half mile away and leveled a long cannon at them. Calvin jerked the wheel right and into the brush as a shell burned past, throwing up mud and debris as it exploded in the road. Calvin righted the wheel and caught another path towards the west, and they continued on.

Over the sound of the jungle and their own engine, the noise of the war machine behind them grew louder and louder. Overhead they could hear helicopters and jets, and in the near distance the sound of more tanks and heavy equipment leveling the forest as they pursued the group. Eventually the trees thinned out and their jeep broke into open grassland.

“Fuck me,” Calvin said, craning his neck to watch the skies behind them, “we’re exposed.”

The sound of blades came fast and loud, and six helicopters were suddenly on them. Calvin pushed the jeep around another hill and into a dusty narrow valley. One of the helicopters came into view above them, and began to fire. Calvin hugged the jeep up against a rocky wall, and Olivia came up from the back seat with a scoped rifle. She braced it against the metal frame of the vehicle and put her eye into the sight.

“Cut it,” she shouted at Calvin, who laid on the brake until they came to a complete stop. The helicopter turned to come around at them again, but broke hard to the left as Olivia swiftly lobotomized the pilot with a bullet. Adam stared at her, perplexed.

“Aren’t you an artist?” he asked.

Olivia shrugged and reloaded. “I was. I’ve been doing this longer.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

Calvin crept towards the edge of the valley and cut through a small passage between two steep cliffs. Another helicopter came into sight as they crested one of them, and Olivia took a shot. The bullet missed the pilot but hit a rotor, causing the craft to sink violently and out of sight. Calvin made another turn, and then one more over a ridge, and then they were out from under the mountain. In front of them was a road winding up into the craggy land past the fields. It pushed through the grassland and then, not far from where they were now, straight into the badlands. Calvin took his foot off the accelerator and they coasted to a stop.

“Ah, shit,” Olivia swore.

Sitting between them and the badlands were military vehicles, hundreds of them, each trained on their jeep sitting on the hill. Above them helicopters circled, and Calvin could make out the shapes of drones just above the cloud layer. Somewhere in the mass of tanks and assault vehicles a horn blared, and the door of a personnel carrier slid open. A man climbed out and closed the door behind him.

He was tall, with broad shoulders and a hearty beard and mustache beneath a wide brimmed hat. He was wearing a brown jacket over a red shirt with jeans, and on his feet were tall, glossy, oiled boots. He stepped forward from the line of guns and waved at them, motioning them to drive down the hill.

“Is that him?” Adam asked, his eyes poking out from behind the back seat.

Calvin nodded. “Sure looks like it.”

Olivia peered down at the man. “What’s our play here?”

Calvin drummed his fingers on the steering wheel. “We could try and ram him. If we got to him before he climbed back inside that vehicle that might do it. But I don’t think we’d even make it that far.” His eyes scanned the long line of metal pointed at them. “We could bolt back the way we came, but I don’t know if we’d make it far.”

“Not a lot of great choices there, boss,” Olivia said, smirking.

Adam leaned around the seat.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “I think if they were going to kill us, they could’ve just as easily done it already,” he said. “Maybe we just drive down there and improvise?”

Calvin turned back to face him. For a moment his steely glare threatened to put a hole in Adam’s forehead, but then he laughed.

“Staring down the face of certain death, and your idea is to wing it.” He shook his head. “Incredible. I love it. Best option we’ve had so far.”

He pulled the wheel around and brought the jeep down from the hill and rested it a few yards from the man in the cowboy hat. They parked, and then Calvin climbed out. Before he turned away, he leaned back to the other two.

“If things get hairy,” he said, “one of you jump in here and gun it. I’m not saying you’ll make it, but you never know.”

With that, he turned back towards the man in the cowboy hat and stopped just short of the front of the jeep.

“Morning,” Calvin said.

“Mornin’,” the man said, smiling. “You must be Calvin, the fella that everyone is talking so much about.”

Calvin shrugged. “Might be. Who’s asking?”

The man laughed. “You’re a little smartass, aren’t you? I like it. The name’s King, Rufus King. You no doubt know about my exploits as a member of some secret underground associations, but let me assure you my loyalties to country come first. So believe me when I say that, whether or not the boss-man would like to hear it, I’m coming you today as an American citizen, not some man in black or anything.”

Calvin raised an eyebrow. “Admittedly, not what I was expecting.”

The American shrugged. “Look son, a man’s got to look out for his interests - and there is nothing I am more interested in than the ongoing safety and security of the United States of America, full stop. I got into this game because I wanted to be able to better anticipate the threats posed by the strange and unusual, and by God I’ve seen my fair share.""")

He reached into his chest pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes, slid one from inside, and caught it in his teeth. He lit it with a flick from a lighter, and took a long draw on it.

“Yes,” he said, “we have benefited immensely from our pact of cooperation with the Foundation. Hell, I wouldn’t even be standing here today if it weren’t for those benefits. We’ve got a good thing going here, and I was hoping to keep that good thing going for a good long while.”

His expression darkened. “But then you had to come along and snatch away our ‘Get Out Of Jail Free’ card when you pushed poor old Felix down that shaft. Now, I’m not dying of old age or disease anytime soon - the Foundation took care of that a long time ago. But now I’m susceptible to all manner of harms and, by extension, so is the United States. That, I’m afraid, just won’t do.”

He pointed back towards the jeep. “However, you’ve got something back there that I think we can reach some sort of agreement on. I’m no monster, Calvin - just an old fashioned South Carolina boy in good standing with some powerful people. I don’t need to see any bloodshed for no reason, so I’ll give you an offer. Might just be the best offer you’re gonna get.”

Calvin squinted at him. “I’m listening.”

The American smiled again. “How about I let you and your two compadres back there scamper back off into the woods, and in exchange you hand over that spear you’ve got your hands on.”

“The spear?” Calvin did a double take. “Why do you want the spear?”

The American flicked the end of his cigarette, sending ashes scattering across the ground. “It’s a funny thing, that spear. I can’t imagine how you would’ve got your hands on it, because we had it locked up tighter than a witch’s cunt.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" You probably don’t even know what it is, do you?”

“I know what it’s called,” Calvin said.

“Sure thing, but you don’t know what it is.” The American laughed. “When we found that thing, it was locked in the dusty grasp of some ancient king. Definitely cursed, though; the lives we spent just trying to pry it out of that bastard’s grip - well, I’ll spare you the details. Just believe me when I say it took some doing. That spear there is the spear they used to pierce the side of Jesus Christ himself, the only one in the world that could’ve done it. How it ended up in that Roman’s hands I’ll never know, but it did the trick then and, apparently, it can do the trick now, too.”

“See,” he continued, “that spear is old, Calvin. It’s got a sort of magic about it that you just don’t see anymore. The things it’s capable of doing surpass any army or bomb I could come up with. You think if Jehovah or Cthulhu or the flying spaghetti monster descend from the heavens and decide to fuck up the United States, that we have any kind of weapon that can deter their advances.” He shook his head. “No, we do not. But that spear could. That spear can kill gods, Calvin. I don’t know if there’s a more deadly stick in the entire world, maybe the whole got-dang universe, and it’s sitting in the back seat of your car right now.”

He held his arms open. “So there’s the deal. Give me the spear, I make America safe again, and you get to go about your merry business with your lives - killing Overseers, overthrowing governments, whatever you want.”

Calvin considered this. “You understand that you’re part of this too, right? It’s not coincidence that you’re next.”

The American cackled. “Am I? I always forget which number I am, just that I’m somewhere in the middle of the voting call.” He took another drag on the cigarette. “I wondered as much when we found Green’s crusty corpse back in that town. Between you and me, Calvin, I didn’t care much for her either.""")

He pulled his pants up slightly by his belt. “That said, I certainly will not stop you if you want to try to kill me, but that will be after we’ve concluded negotiations here and you have handed over the spear.”

Calvin shook his head. “I can’t do that.”

The American smiled again, but this time there was something sinister about it. The sincerity in his expression had run dry.

“Yeah, I was worried you’d say that,” he said, adjusting his belt. “You know, I could kill you right here, right now, with no effort at all. Could’ve done so last night when you three were hunched in a cave in the middle of the woods. It would’ve been easy, Calvin, and really, this decision should’ve been easy too. But you’ve made it difficult for us, and now we have a decision to make.”

He sighed. “I don’t know what you think you’re trying to accomplish, and frankly I don’t give two fucks about the ideological war you think you’re fighting. All that matters to me is getting that spear, and as easy as it would be to just take it, that wouldn’t be very sporting. Besides,” he cracked his knuckles, “it’s been a little while and I’ve got some muscle to flex.”

He pointed into the sky behind Calvin, who turned around to see a Chinook helicopter descending through the clouds with a massive steel crate strapped to its underside. “In that box,” The American said, “is something nasty. So nasty, in fact, that we’ve been trying to kill it for years, but just haven’t had any luck.” He tapped a finger against his head. “What I think I’m going to do is this: I’m going to let you go. I’m going to let you climb back in that jeep, give you a little water, and let you drive off into the hills. Then, after a few hours, I’m going to point that box in your direction and open it.""")

He flicked the cigarette butt over towards Calvin. “That’s what we’ll do. I like that. Seems more fair.”

Calvin glared at him. “What if I pull a gun on you, right now, and kill you here?”

The American laughed. “I asked myself the same thing. See, the difference between if you try to kill me and if I try to kill you is that I’m definitely killing you. You pull a gun on me here and the 7th Infantry turns you and your friends into dust. Or, alternatively, you march out there into the rocks and dirt and die out there, only a little later. Either way, your little journey is drawing to a close. All that’s left to decide now is how you want it to end.”

Calvin stood there for a moment longer, and then turned back to the jeep. He climbed in the driver’s seat and fired up the engine, and slowly they began driving towards the line of tanks and guns. As they did, the vehicles all pulled out of the way revealing the road into the badlands, and allowed them to pass by.

As they pulled alongside The American, the man put a hand on Calvin’s door. He leaned in and smiled at Olivia and Adam, and tossed a half-full canteen into the back seat.

“Ya’ll have a safe trip, now.” He slapped the door. “We’ll be seeing each other again here real soon.”

Calvin put his foot into the gas, and the jeep sped off down the long road into the hills.

Once the long line of The American’s division had disappeared into the distance, the three of them began to breathe easier. Calvin wiped his brow with the back of his hand.

“Smooth move, kid,” he said to Adam. “Improvising was a good choice.”

Adam, though, was not happy. “Yeah, I guess.” He paused. “Why didn’t you just give him the spear, Cal?”

Calvin looked back at him through the rearview. “It’s important that we hold onto it. Giving it up isn’t an option.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

Adam’s brow furrowed, but his next question didn’t come out of his mouth, but from Olivia’s. “Where did you find it?” she asked.

Calvin was quiet for a moment. “When I was younger my mother and I escaped from my father - he was a drinker and like to hit us when he wasn’t drinking. When we got out we went to the countryside where my aunt lived. We used to take walks through the fields and the woods, just her and I, and those were some of the happiest times in my entire life.”

“Then one day,” he continued, “we were walking by a lake and she said she recognized somebody out in it. When I turned to look I saw bodies, maybe hundreds of them, and she walked towards the lake and then into it and disappeared. I went in after her and I could hear the bodies talking to me, and I saw my mother and she just smiled at me and sank into the waters and I never saw her again. I fought through those corpses for hours and nobody would believe me when I told them she’d been taken into the lake.”

He sighed. “I went back there, recently. I hadn’t been back since my aunt shipped me off to boarding school, but I went back. The bodies are gone, and the paths to get there are overgrown, but the lake is still there. While I was there - getting my bearings, I guess - I was approached by someone. I don’t-” he hesitated, “I could barely remember what they looked like even immediately after they left. I don’t know how to describe them, other than they sounded… tired? Empty? Like the voice of a person superimposed over a ghost.”

“What did they want?” Adam asked.

“They told me two things. They told me my name, and they told me that I was an agent of the Insurgency. I assumed they were Foundation or GOC or something so I shot at them.” He laughed. “Seems stupid now, but I had no idea who they were - still don’t, and they came up all spooky-like and, well. Either way, the bullets passed straight through them, like they weren’t even there.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" They told me to relax, and that they weren’t there to harm me, but that they had something they needed to give me.”

“I followed them through the woods until we reached a spot below a cliff. There were these brambles in between us and the cliff face, but as we walked through them they just sort of melted away. Once they were gone I saw it - a metal door in the rock, with the Foundation arrows on it. This person, whoever it was, opened the door and led me inside. There were some old filing cabinets full of papers and a ton of dust; I bet nobody had been in there in decades. This person points towards a door on the far end of this little narrow room and tells me that there’s a tool past that door I can use to destroy the Foundation. They told me that, if I chose to go in there and take it, I’d have to make a horrible choice - and that if I could do that, I could have it.”

Olivia frowned. “What was the choice?”

Calvin took a deep breath. “When I walked through the door, I was suddenly out by the lake, only I was just a kid again and I was walking with my mother. She- I don’t think it was a dream. I reached out and grabbed her hand and it was real. Then-” he paused, “-then we passed by the lake again, and I saw her walking down towards the water, and there were so many bodies. I started running after her, and it was different this time, because I knew what she was doing before she did it, and I was just an arms length away. I could have grabbed her, or tackled her, and kept her from going in. When I was younger I had just frozen up until it was too late, but this time I could do something. I could save her.”

He tapped his finger against the steering wheel. “But as I came up behind her something stopped me. When I looked back towards the treeline, I saw this person who had led me to the door, standing there on the edge of the forest. They- they were just standing there, and I realized then, I think, that they had always been standing there.""")

He swallowed hard. “So I turned back and went to the person in the trees and took the canister from them. When I turned back towards the lake, she was already gone.” He wiped at something in his eye with the palm of his hand. “When I came to, I was standing by the lake again as an adult, but I had the canister. I had always had the canister, ever since that day when I was a kid at the lake.”

They all sat in silence for several long seconds, before Calvin continued. “This person, whoever they were, they came up beside me at the lake and told me my name and that I was an agent of the Insurgency. They asked if I remembered them and I told them I did. They handed me something else - the two vials of water. When I asked who they were they didn’t tell me, but something about the way they looked at me was just… perpetually sad. I took the vials, and then they told me they were sorry. I blinked, and they were gone.”

“Christ,” Adam said, sinking back in his seat. “I’m sorry. I just thought it was a really good spear.”

Calvin snorted. “It is a really good spear. You saw what it did to those guys on the stairs back in the city.” He shook his head. “No wonder Uncle Sam back there wants to get his hands on it.” He rubbed his chin. "Once I realized what it was capable of, I gave it to the Library for safekeeping. Best place to put something you never want to be found again."

Olivia was thinking. “Hang on,” she said, “if this person gave you the spear when you were a kid, and the vials more recently, then where did you get the journal?”

“Jacked him?” Olivia exclaimed. “You mean, like, you punched him? Jesus, Cal, isn’t Skitter Marshall like, 90 years old?”

“Oh yeah, absolutely flattened the lad,” Calvin said, grinning. “Don’t feel too bad, though. I think he’s probably had a few pulls off the Fountain of Youth at some point in his past too, so he’s still in pretty good shape. Once he was down I snatched it from his coat pocket.”

“Didn’t he have bodyguards or something?” Olivia asked.

“Whoa, hold up,” Adam said, his eyes growing wide. “Is that what you were having me doing?”

Calvin burst out laughing. “Oh yeah, it was perfect. I had Adam fuck with their GPS - they were a street over and had no idea what was going on. The only person Marshall had nearby was his driver, and I punched that guy too.”

Adam rolled his eyes. “You had me break into Google Maps so you could punch an old man?”

“Absolutely,” Calvin said, nodding furiously. “Just clocked him, too.”

A few hours later the clouds overhead cleared. Adam leaned out to look at the sky and smiled.

“Finally,” he said with relief. “Clear skies.”

Calvin looked back at him. “Enjoying the weather?”

Adam was quickly pulling his laptop out and slapping an antennae on the side of the jeep. “I had an idea earlier, but wanted to check something out first.” He stared at the screen as information danced across it, and his face lit up. “Hey, Delta said that The American is a cocky son-of-a-bitch, didn’t he?”

Calvin rolled his eyes. “Get to the point.”

“Ok,” Adam said, nodding slowly. “Ok, ok. Yes. Ok. So, I also have a tragic story from my youth that is about to become useful.”

Calvin and Olivia snorted in unison. “Go for it,” Calvin said. “Lead the way.”

“We’re actually really close to the town I grew up in,” Adam said. “My parents immigrated down here when I was a baby, and we ended up in one of these little mountain villages.”

“Why do we need to go there?” Olivia asked.

“Just trust me,” Adam said. “I’m not saying it’s a perfect plan, but if you think The American is cocky and stupid enough to try and march his army up a mountain, it’s a plan.”

He pointed Calvin in the direction of a road leading east. The sun was getting low in the sky behind them, and before too long the sound of distant helicopter rotors cut across the mountains. Shortly afterward, the sound of treads and diesel accompanied it, and then something else. It was a low, moaning sound, something like an animal in pain. These sounds continued to pursue them, but didn’t arrive before they had pulled off the road and into a small, quiet, seemingly abandoned village. Calvin parked and the three of them climbed out of the jeep, walking carefully towards the center of town.

“Privet?” Adam called out. “Hello? Is anyone here?”

The first glint of the setting sun of a helicopter blade poked around the mountain, and they ducked into a house. It was empty.

Olivia looked around the room as Calvin posted up at the window. “What happened here? Everything is still in place - it looks like whoever lived here before didn’t take any of their stuff when they left.”

Adam grimaced slightly. “We didn’t.""")

Suddenly they heard a loud clattering from across the small town square. Something moved past the window, causing Calvin and Olivia to both draw weapons. Adam held a hand up.

“You two are going to need to chill,” he said, “at least for a minute. Don’t shoot anything yet.”

They snuck out the back of the house and followed the ridge behind the houses to the far end of the road, just across from where they had heard the sound. They sprinted across the street to the house. The thin front door was standing open. Adam leaned inside and pulled a flashlight out from his bag. He pointed it inside and turned it on.

A figure was standing in the far corner of the room - a shorter, round man wearing a thick, dirty shawl and no other clothes. His skin was pale and, in some places, unusually red. He was swaying slowly, and Calvin noticed something strange about the way his body was shaped but couldn’t place it.

Adam took a step inside, holding a hand out in front of him. “Father Bramimond?” he asked in Russian. “Is that you?”

The man turned slightly and looked at Adam. The right side of his face bulged significantly, as if something was pushing up against the skin from beneath. When he saw Adam, the man smiled.

“Ah, little bird,” the man responded. His speech was thick and each word was accompanied by a spray of spittle. “Welcome home.”

Adam looked the man up and down. From their position outside Calvin and Olivia could see Adam’s face, and there was a sort of resigned sadness to it. He managed a weak smile.

“Father,” Adam said, “where is everyone? Have they all left?”

The man tottered slightly towards Adam. “No, no little bird. They are here. They are all around us. The sickness came for them, just as it came for me.” He ran a thick hand across his bulging, exposed belly. “It will come for us all, in time. My ascension has nearly arrived.”

“Something you both need to know,” he said, pulling his gun from its holster. “When I was younger, people here started getting sick. Nobody could explain it and no cure seemed to help. As they got sicker, they would… change.”

“Like that guy back there?” Calvin said.

Adam cringed. “Father Bramimond was one of the last holdouts. People who got sick were sent into the mountains around here so they wouldn’t inflict anyone else, but others always got sick anyway. The Foundation showed up eventually and put those of us who were left to work cleaning out the mountains, but…” he trailed off, his eyes growing wide. Calvin and Olivia turned to look behind them.

Coming up the path to the mountain was a line of tanks, slowly crawling across the rock and gravel. Men in personnel carriers and on foot followed behind, a long, winding column that stretched as far down as they could see, and at the head of the line was The American standing up in his humvee, smiling and holding out a long, black whip. He brought it up over his head and with a deafening crack, pulled it down across the body of the creature in front of him.

It was massive, vaguely reptilian, with too many eyes and mottled green skin. It had long, thick strands of oily hair that dragged across the ground with every plodding step. Its mouth was long like a crocodile but its teeth looked like those of a snake. Every time The American brought the whip down across the creature’s back, it moaned in a horrid, foul agony. As they drew near to the town, the Overseer pulled a megaphone out from inside his vehicle and clicked it on.

“You’re a tricky sumbitch, Calvin!” he shouted, his amplified voice echoing off the mountains surrounding them.""")

Now, I’m not saying you can, but the way I see it I’m walking into this little gathering with two problems and leaving with one. I’ll leave it up to you to decide what that’s gonna be.”

He hopped down from the humvee and slapped the creature on the side, causing it to growl menacingly. He gestured towards the group with the whip, and said something to the beast. Then, with an almost obscene viciousness, he brought the whip down on the creature several times in quick succession. It howled in rage and charged across the small dirt road towards where Adam, Calvin, and Olivia stood. They turned to run, but something waddling out into the street caught their eye and made them hesitate.

Father Bramimond was standing between the charging reptilian monstrosity and them, unmoving. The creature continued to charge but then hesitated and came to a stop just before reaching the old man. It leaned down to look at him, its eyes tightening. From deep within its gut they heard words - a voice, deep and gnarled like the roots of an old tree. Not truly of this world but unfortunately placed within it.

“What… what is this?” The creature took another step forward. “This… filth.”

Father Bramimond stumbled slightly, then gathered himself up. From where they were standing they could see something moving, just under his skin. It had begun to seep in some places and blood was now flowing out of his ears. He extended his arms wide and smiled.

“I have ascended,” he said, his voice sloppy with orgasmic stupor.

Before he could finish his sentence, Father Bramimond’s skin split from the top of his head down to his groin. His eyes bulged and burst. His smiling face pulled apart and fell off to each side, and his torso expanded rapidly. The reptilian creature recoiled, its eyes wide with confusion. The thing that had been Father Bramimond collapsed to the ground and writhed there, like an insect breaking free from its cocoon. After a moment it stopped moving, and the town was silent.

Then came another sound, more horrible even than the moans of the reptilian creature. It came from the pile of flesh and meat on the ground, and then echoed off into the mountains. It was half a dying animal, half a regurgitated human cry of terror. The sound that come out of the pile was suddenly joined by many other similar sounds coming from the rocks and high places around them.

The pile of meat began to writhe again, and up from it came an abomination. It was slick with blood and fluid, all pink and red and yellow. Its face, if it could be called that, was long and bore no notable features. It had many appendages, and more that came unfolded from its back and hung akimbo by its sides. Father Bramimond’s loose skin lay discarded on the ground, but his hateful flesh screamed its birthing cry.

The ground beneath them began to shake. There was the distinct sound of cracking rock as a nearby cliff face appeared to buckle, then collapse. The tumbling stone kicked up a cloud of dust, but when the dust settled there was nothing behind it but blackness. Out of that blackness came more cries, and then more from above. Another skin-creature appeared on a ledge nearby, then another. Then hundreds. Then thousands, each of them screaming and writhing and dancing a hellish dance in the light of the setting sun.

More gunshots, and then the howls reached a fever pitch and the mass of flesh and gore crashed down the mountainside towards the 7th Infantry.

At the head of the line was the lizard, who now turned back with malice in its eyes at the writhing form of what had been Father Bramimond. It struck out with its long teeth, but the creature moved too quickly and slid around the lizard. Its long, meaty appendaged stuck to the side of the massive reptile, who roared and clawed at its back as the flesh beast began to envelop it. The ground beneath them shook again, and suddenly the ground was falling away. Below the cracks they could see hair, and flesh, and eyes, all staring skyward and full of blood and hate. Thick tendrils of flesh rose up from the ground as the acrid smell of gunpowder and smoke filled the air, all while more and more of the skinwalkers flew down the mountainside and out of the caves.

Calvin had grabbed Adam and Olivia, and the three of them were now sprinting towards another humvee, left abandoned by its previous occupants who were now being pulled into the earth screaming by a mass of hands and teeth. As they got near, one of the flesh things came running at them. Calvin threw a heavy kick at the creature, but his foot stuck in the putrid mass of flesh and began to sink into the thing’s skin. On its face, something like a sucker opened up and began to descend towards Calvin before being removed from the rest of its body in a hail of bullets from Olivia’s rifle.

Calvin threw the humvee into motion and they swiftly avoided a flaming personnel carrier that crashed into a nearby building. They drove past a church and then another row of houses, and came out on the other side of the main square. In the distance they could see the fires and the flesh and the panicked soldiers packed together in a horrible crush of man and meat. Near them, however, in the middle of the town square, was another scene entirely.

The flesh beast that had once been Father Bramimond had grown dramatically in size, and was now grappling with the lizard as the two tore at each other. Standing on the lizard’s back, one hand wrapped around a thick chain connected to a spike driven into the lizard’s spine and another wrapped around the black whip was The American. His hat had been knocked off and his shirt was ripped and soaked with blood, but the ferocity in his eyes was like that of a hound, wracked with bloodlust and fury. He cracked the whip against the reptile’s back, spurring it onward while he cackled like a madman.

“Get fucked, you ugly-ass meat goblin!” he shouted, yanking the chain left and right. He pulled the whip back behind his head and lashed it forward towards the flesh creature that had been Father Bramimond, which recoiled from the strike.

He was interrupted as Olivia shouldered her rifle and took a shot at him. The Overseer brought his whip up furiously and caught the bullet in midair, shattering it with a resounding pop. She fired again and he caught it again. She fired a third time out of rhythm, and the tip of the whip missed the bullet. The American stumbled and caught himself on the chain, his whip-hand held up to his chest. When it pulled it away, it was covered in blood.

The American looked back up at them. His face was covered in shock and disbelief, and he dropped the whip and started to idly rub the spot on his heart where blood was now cascading from. Calvin thought he could see the Overseer start to say something, but before any words left his lips he let go of the chain and toppled off the reptile’s back, into the throng of howling meat creatures. They descended on him like ghouls, ripping and tearing pieces of his body away and incorporating them into their own. Then the mass descended upon the reptile, who finally succumbed to the weight of the massive flesh creature and all of the many thousands of small creatures and was pulled, piece by piece, into the earth.

They sat on the ridge overlooking the small village until the last scrap of meat had been pulled from the lizard’s bones and the tide of flesh began to recede again into the mountains. Once the last of the meat monsters had disappeared, the reptile’s skeleton collapsed into dust, out of which crawled the tiniest of lizards.

The air would get hazy sometimes, like it was full of pollen. Spores, maybe. You’d breathe them and then start getting sick and then you’d go into the hills. My sisters went that way, and my dad. Eventually the Foundation showed up, stuck us in orange jumpsuits and put flamethrowers in our hands, and sent us out to burn back the infestation.”

Finding this place and somewhere to hide was a godsend, and then this happened.” He paused. “I think, for me, if someone tells me that there’s a way to stop this sort of thing from happening, well… yeah. I think I’d be down for that.”

Calvin nodded. “It’s what Anthony would’ve wanted.”

They agreed. Calvin turned the wheel on the humvee, and together the three of them crawled into the mountains and away from the ruination of the 7th Infantry.

— - —

As they came around the corner of a narrow road through the mountains, they could see a city in the valley below them. Running through that city was a road, one they knew would take them further into China and towards civilization. Calvin was scanning the road, carefully watching even the slightest shadow out of place in the starlit night. Olivia was cleaning her rifle with the end of a thin paintbrush. Adam was looking out the window pensively.

“So that’s seven down, right?” the young man said.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “The dead guy in the tower, the math guy, the multiple personality person who kidnapped Liv, that crazy snake woman, the one who killed herself, the other one who killed himself, sort of, then Green and Mr. USA back there.” He counted on his fingers. “Hang on, that’s eight.”

Calvin snorted. “Aren’t you supposed to be the math one?”

Adam glared at him. “Reliving traumatic moments from my youth have thrown me off my game today. Anyway,” he continued, “so who does that bring up next?”

“They call him ‘Blackbird’,” Olivia responded, not taking her eyes off her work. “He’s a strange one - the journal doesn’t say anything about where to find him, just that ‘he has a way of just showing up’. I don’t know what that means.”

Suddenly Calvin stomped on the brake, sending Olivia and Adam into the dashboard and onto the floor, respectively. They scrambled up, each pulling a weapon as Calvin did the same and stepped out of the truck.

Standing in the road in front of them was a small, strange looking man. His eyes were slightly too big for his head and he had a hooked nose with neatly parted hair. He was wearing a three-piece suit with a bow-tie. In his jacket pocket was a silver pocket square with a black crown embroidered onto it.

As Calvin cautiously stepped towards him, the man smiled warmly and extended his arms.

“Good evening!” he said. “I hear you are going to soon be looking for me, yes?”

Male. British/Moroccan ancestry. Age uncertain. Generally regarded as the most jovial members of the Council, is not afraid to be seen joking in public. Has often commented that he believes the "dark curtain" between Overwatch Command and the rest of the Foundation, as well as the "unnecessary seriousness" of the Council itself, are a preposterous and often detrimental joke.

Despite this, there are several incongruities surrounding O5-5. Some sources have indicated that they believe they have heard O5-5 talking to himself as if he were having a conversation, while others have described conversing with O5-5, and then speaking to him again shortly afterwards and feeling as if they were not talking to the same person. In the debriefing of the neutralization of SCP-1730, one source described how a rescued member of the Site-13 staff was able to identify a picture of O5-5 as a member of the Global Occult Coalition in their world.

Aside from forming the Department of Paranormal Organization Review, O5-5 has apparently led considerable research into the existence of alternate realities, and is known to personally review anomalies that interact with other dimensions as they arise.

# CHAPTER IX
## WHAT THE BLACKBIRD SAW

BEFORE

— - —

They were crammed into the small, dingy motel room - Adam sitting in a corner idly perusing an anarchoblog on his laptop, Olivia sitting on the bed drying her hair, Calvin sitting in the window watching cars pass on the dark street below them and Anthony relaxing on the other bed, eating a sandwich. They had the television on, but none of them were watching. Every so often they would hear footsteps in the hallway and all stop what they were doing until the sound disappeared around the corner. It was after one of these pauses that Adam broke the silence.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

“Anthony,” he asked, closing his laptop and kicking up his feet, “you said you were alive during the Schism, right?”

Anthony grunted.

“First of all, that’s still crazy. Second, why did the Schism happen in the first place?”

The older man stopped chewing and swallowed. “Ideological quibbles.”

Calvin rolled his eyes and Adam pouted. “No, seriously,” Adam said. “It didn’t seem like the Foundation had been around that long. What could’ve happened in such a short amount of time to cause a rift like that?”

Anthony set his sandwich down on the bedside table. “There was a profound disagreement from the beginning about what the Foundation had to offer. Back then we had this enemy, see - we called them Abbadon. We were led to believe the Abbadon was this group of desperate, hostile reality benders that were attacking our storehouses to loot our artifacts. The threat of Abbadon showing up on our doorstep everyday led us away from just researching and containing anomalies - suddenly we were concerned with protecting ourselves. Reaching outside our bounds.”

He took a drink from a can on the table. “We began a project to build this thing, this eigenweapon, that we could use to end Abbadon once and for all. Felix Carter, the Thirteenth Overseer, he was in charge of the occult research that went into developing the rituals we used to bind unparalleled power to a word, a word that could be used to annihilate anything in the universe in an instant with nothing more than a thought. We-”

He paused as another set of footsteps proceeded past the door with little incident.

“We did something,” he continued, “during the development of that weapon, that was truly heinous. I am convinced there is no greater sin than the one we committed to create that perfect gun, and I am half convinced the Overseers only signed that deal with Death to avoid the fires of Hell we’re all now destined for.”

He paused again and took another drink. “Anyway, we were fooled.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Abbadon was an excuse, one perpetrated by the Administrator to, for the first time, create an anomaly. Give form to something that had not existed before we started. We succeeded, but at a terrible cost. The Schism was a result of the two lingering factions after that event - those who believed that creating that weapon was a net good, and those who believed it was a net evil. The ones who stayed thought that the ends justified what we had done, and that creating that weapon had created a safer world. Myself and several others rightly believed that we had done something unspeakable, and that the Foundation couldn’t continue to exist. That it was rotten to its core.”

Adam pondered this for a moment. “What happened to that weapon?”

“They buried it,” he said without hesitation. “It could only be activated with the word, and the only person who knew what that word was defected with us. Aaron Siegel, The Engineer, the man who is currently the First Overseer. When they realized they couldn’t use it anymore, they split up its component parts to keep them from being activated, and he could never use it again - word or otherwise.”

“What caused the defection, then?” Olivia asked, scrubbing at her face with a washcloth. “What made Aaron Siegel go back?”

“Arrogance and lust,” he spat. “They called with a better offer and he picked up the phone.”

He leaned back against the thin, dingy pillows. “When we defected, Aaron Siegel killed the Administrator, thinking that would be the end of the Foundation. But the Administrator was just one man, and the Foundation was much more decentralized than it is today. The difference between then and now is a matter of scale. The Foundation of today has fully realized itself, and its core is less a connection of a few veins and more its bleeding, beating heart. There is power in the directors and everything, but true authority rests with the Overseers. When they’re gone, the Foundation will be a snake without its head.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

He pulled out a cigarette and lit it. Calvin slid the window open slightly more in response and shot him a look.

“And more than that,” he continued, “you’ve probably heard that all of the Foundation’s sites and storehouses sit on top of nuclear devices - a last chance option if something terrible happens. They’re not under every site, but they are under most. At Site-01, there is a system in place that will activate when there is only one Overseer left, a command that goes out to arm all of those bombs. If we get there and kill Aaron Siegel, we can use that system to destroy everything - the sites, the anomalies, all of it. We’ll still have work to do, but we’ll have trumped them.”

Calvin was looking at him from the corner of his eye. “How do you know this exists?”

“I designed it,” Anthony said. “We didn’t have nuclear weapons when I designed it, but the concept is the same. You could even do it from his desk. One button, and poof - it’s all gone.” He picked his sandwich back up and nodded. “That’s our play. That’s how we do it.”



NOW

— - —

Calvin was two steps out of the humvee with his gun drawn. Olivia was close behind him, but the man in the middle of the road didn’t move. He held up both hands, palms out, and waved them slightly.

“Look, see?” he showed them the backs of his hands. “No guns. I’m not here for violence.”

“Who are you?” Calvin asked.

The man made a large, sweeping bow. He was slightly hunchbacked, and when he bent over they could see the deviation in his spine.

“I am Mortimer J. Denning Von Kronecker,” he said, standing back up. “I’m your next Overseer. Number Five, you see.” He gave them a knowing elbow. “I noticed you were going down numerically. Not maybe the most unique approach, but I’ll admit it’s narratively consistent.”

Olivia raised an eyebrow. “You’re the Blackbird?”

The man made a dismissive gesture. “Please, Blackbird is my work name.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" I’m not here on work, obviously, though-” he gave them both a look, “-it seems that you two are.”

Calvin raised his gun as if to fire, and then hesitated. “What are you doing here?”

“Me?” Mortimer raised a hand to his mouth. “Why, I came to meet you! I have seen some incredible things - many incredible things, if you believe half the stories they tell about me, but I’ve never met someone who has, in one way or another, killed eight Overseers.” He crossed his arms and nodded. “That is impressive. That’s never been done before, not even by the Overseers themselves!”

“If you know why we’re here, then why did you seek us out?” Olivia asked. “You know we’re trying to kill you.”

The man laughed. “Yes, well, I did know that. But see, unfortunately for both of us, killing me is sort of a non-starter, even after your little whoopsie with Felix back at the Spire.” He gestured at Calvin. “Here, I’ll show you. This will help establish some rules. Shoot me.” He tapped on his forehead. “Right here, square between the eyes if you can.”

Calvin raised his gun again but paused. He looked at Olivia, who looked back at him with uncertainty. Mortimer rolled his eyes and produced a knife from inside his sleeve.

“Fine, fine,” he said, “we can do it this way too.”

Holding the knife in his left hand and bracing the bottom of it with his right, Mortimer drove the blade of the knife into his head through his neck. Blood splashed out onto the ground and he immediately went cross-eyed as a gargling gasp escaped his lips. He pushed one more time with his right hand and the end of the knife lodged perfectly into his skull. He stumbled backwards and collapsed.

The three of them sat staring at the man on the ground in shock.

“What the hell was that?” Adam said from behind them.

Then, suddenly, the road in front of them was illuminated by a dark purple light.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" It pulsed twice, and then with a snapping sound and the distinct smell of ozone, the Blackbird appeared before them again, unscathed. He held out his arms as if performing a magic trick, and then gestured to the corpse on the ground.

“See?” he said. “Voila. Good as new.”

“You’re anomalous,” Olivia stated.

Mortimer nodded. “But really, who isn’t anymore?” He held a finger to his chin. “You know, now that I’m thinking about it I believe that Green wasn’t. I think that always got to her, you know? She had all these machinations-” he gestured wildly, “-that would’ve been so much easier to achieve if she could do the things I can do.”

“What can you do?” Calvin said, lowering his gun.

The Overseer held up a finger. “Ah, that’s a good question! Let’s start with a better one - where I’m from.” He turned as if to walk away, and then stopped midstep to turn back and motion them to follow. “Come on, let’s go. You can leave your belongings here, nobody is going to come after them for a while.”

The three of them hesitantly started walking behind him. As they fell in step, they noticed the sky changing. It had been night, but now it was a deep, rich purple that was occasionally disturbed by ripples emanating from somewhere in the distance. The landscape around them began to change as well - gone were the hills leading up into the mountains, now they walked on a cobblestone street through a city they did not recognize. The sky above them began to change again, fading out from purple and into a sullen grey. A light rain was falling and a chill hit them from behind.

“This,” Mortimer said, turning back to look at them, “is my home - where I am from, anyway. I was born here, in the city of London. London, population two-point-five million, is the last city on Earth. Isn’t that something?”

They stared around in muted amazement. Something dark and massive passed overhead, and they were momentarily drenched in shadow.

“What happened here?” Adam asked.

The Overseer shrugged.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “You remember the Black Death? You no doubt read about it in a history book or something - a very tragic event in your world’s history. Well, as it turns out the Black Death hit this world very hard. There was this fellow in the Out There who woke up just in time to catch it at its worst, and told everyone he had a cure. As you can imagine, people were eager to take him up on the proposition. Only problem was, the Plague wasn’t exactly what he was curing.” He waggled his eyebrows. “If you know what I mean.”

He turned back to look down the dull street. At the far end, a horse drawn carriage passed by - the horse looking little more than a skeleton.

“In your world - the one you were born in, this entity exists. We have him contained, in fact - stuffed in a cell somewhere. He’s much different there than he is here, I doubt there would be much we could do to inhibit this fellow.” He paused. “Anyway, city after city began to fall, all around the world. But not London. The Forefathers built her walls strong and her defenses stalwart. For a time we had allies - Paris, Munich, Rome. Even some much further away. Slowly, over time, they all went silent. London is all that’s left.”

He started walking again, and they followed. He led them down the street and then out into a large, open thoroughfare that was empty except for them.

“Now, as for what I can ‘do’. You’ve no doubt picked up on part of it - walking hither and yon between realities is both useful and obvious. But before you can go somewhere, you need to see where it is you’re going.”

He pointed up into the sky and closed his eyes. “You’ve met my good ex-friend The Accountant already. He was very good with numbers, and there were some who thought he could see the future. He couldn’t really, just like I can’t really. But I can do him one better. See, they’ll tell you there are infinitely many universes, and for the layman that might as well be true. But it’s not actually true.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" There is a functional end to all creation - a hard limit, if you will. There are only so many atoms and so many interactions. It might seem like infinity to your average guy on the street, but I can see those variations - each and every one of them. If there are more of some than there are of others, I know that in any one universe that event would be more likely.”

He stopped again. “Now imagine you’re a young Mortimer J. Denning Von Kronecker, and you live in a shit city on a shit island at the end of the world. The skies are always grey, the air is always toxic, and on the other side of the channel outside of these walls is a nightmare that could kill you in a heartbeat. You have dreams - dreams of a place like yours, but different. Brighter. Happier. A smaller chance of imminent death. You can see it, clear as day. Then one day you hear a voice calling out to you from this place - and it’s your own voice. They’re not you, but they are you.”

He turned back. “I heard that voice, and took those first steps into a place that wasn’t my own. This place, this London, is part of a dying world. If it makes it another six months it’ll be a miracle. I had no family, no friends. Nobody wanted a lame orphan who was hearing voices.” He shrugged. “So I left.”

“Hang on,” Olivia said, rubbing her temple. “You can see other realities?”

Mortimer looked up curiously, as if forming a thought. “See… no. It’s not like I can open my eyes and look at them, not really. It’s more like I can… hear them.”

He started walking again. They passed an empty butcher shop, an empty bank, an empty apartment building.

“You remember when I said I heard my own voice?” he asked. “That was true. When I came through there I found another me, and together we found another. We kept running into each other until there were no more of me left undiscovered, and then we all just sort of… came together. Unified, if you will.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" There are still a lot of me in here,” he tapped his head, “but we all more or less speak the same language now. This works out well, because if one of me ever dies, the others can just break that one off and stay intact. Does that make sense? Sort of like an onion. You peel one layer back, and there’s more onion underneath.” He rubbed his chin. “I think that’s a reference to something.”

“I still don’t understand,” Olivia said, “if you’re all in the same place now, how do you hear these other dimensions?”

“Realities,” he said, holding up a finger. “Dimensions are different and I don’t dabble in those. That was the tricky bit, but sometimes things just have a way of working out. In my travels I found someone else like me, someone else who was maybe not quite so organized as I was, but could still hear herself wherever she is out there. Her name was Alison, the daughter of one of the Foundation senior staff members. She and her… sisters? That’s not right. She and the other versions of herself struck a deal with me. I show up whenever she needs a little ‘muscle’ and she keeps me informed of everything happening… everywhere. Do you understand?”

Calvin stopped walking. “So why did you bring us here? What do you want?”

Mortimer paused and then turned around. He was still smiling, but it was more somber somehow.

“I know what you’re trying to do,” he said, “and I’m sympathetic, trust me. I know you’re adamant about what you want to accomplish and I know that nothing that I can say personally can change that - and that’s fair. Thing is, I don’t know if you’re right or not, or if your crusade will make any sort of difference in the grand scheme. I have some ideas, but I’m not sure. Just in case, I want to try and keep it from happening, because if for some reason you succeed and I lose touch with all of the me that’s in here, well…” he paused. “I don’t really know what would happen, to be honest. I don’t think it would be good.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

“So I’m going to give you something!” His smile diminished slightly when he saw their faces turn. “Oh, no, this isn’t like other deals I’m sure the others gave you. Especially since they were, what, Valerie and Rufus? Those two are nasty.” He shook his head. “I’m sure they resorted to horrible things in order to dissuade you, and look where that got them! Me, though, I can do better than that.”

They stopped in front of another empty shop with three doors. Somewhere in the distance a flare went up, and they were briefly bathed in red light. When they looked back, there were three men standing in front of the doors, each identical to the others.

“I’m going to offer you an out,” Mortimer said, the voices speaking in perfect unison. “Not an out that’s just in your head like The Liar might’ve offered, or an out that’s not really an out at all and mostly just results in your death like Rufus would’ve preferred. No, this is a bonafide, 100% guaranteed out. If you take it, it’s yours. I can arrange all the paperwork and make it happen, but it’s there if you want it.”

Each of the three men stepped aside, exposing the now open doors behind them. One for each of them.

“We go through these,” Calvin said slowly, “and what, we’re killed immediately? Is this a joke?”

Mortimer’s face softened. For the first time he no longer appeared unceasingly genial - instead, he looked tired.

“No, it’s not a joke - and there’s no funny business here. I’m just looking for a way we can both benefit from this.”

They each looked at each other, and after a minute Olivia shrugged.

“I mean, what else are we going to do?” she said. “Shoot him?”

Calvin and Adam nodded in agreement, and the three of them each entered separate doors.

— - —

Adam found himself standing in a warmly lit room on a shaggy carpet. Somewhere on the street below, a man was playing something on a saxophone. There was a small fireplace, and a fire burning within it.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Something was cooking in the next room, and it smelled heavenly. Adam scanned the room for something familiar, but found nothing.

“It’s over there, if you’re looking for it,” the Blackbird said, suddenly appearing next to him. “Over there in the corner, I mean. Your laptop, right? That’s what you’re looking for? I notice you don’t really ever part with it.”

“What is this?” Adam said, confused. “Where am I?”

“This is Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Can’t remember the address exactly. You’ve actually been here once before, when you were younger. Your parents briefly sought asylum here.”

Adam looked back around the room. “That’s right,” he said, nodding. “We lived in the town in the mountains after this.”

The Blackbird walked over to the window and looked out at the street. Adam continued scanning the room. “Why here?”

“Because in this world, your asylum was granted,” the Blackbird said without looking up. “You grew up here, with both of your parents and your siblings. They’re all still alive, too. Your parents moved to Los Angeles, but you liked it here most of all. This felt like home to you.”

Adam didn’t respond. It did feel like home. He remembered the thick carpet and the drapes that were just a little musty. Even the stupid little fireplace had made him so happy as a child. It was perfect, exactly as he remembered it but better, except-

“Adam,” a voice called from the kitchen. It was dark and rough - and familiar. Adam felt his heartbeat quicken slightly as he took a few steps around the edge of the sofa in the middle of the room. A moment later, Calvin’s head poked around the corner.

“Dinner,” he said. He raised an eyebrow and looked around. “Who are you talking to?”

Adam hesitated, his voice catching in his throat. He turned to look at the Blackbird for some response, but the man was staring straight ahead, unblinking.

“Are you surprised?” the Overseer said. “You can’t hide from me, Adam Ivanov.” He tapped a finger on the side of his head.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “There was a time once when I too desired certain comforts. Pleasures of the flesh, as you know. The girl Alison has had her usefulness there, but I will admit I find your tastes far more fulfilling than my own.”

Adam turned back to Calvin, who was no longer moving. The world had grown very still. From his position in the living room, quietly shaking and unable to control his heart, Adam saw a silver band on one of Calvin’s fingers. He felt blood rush into his face.

“There are struggles here,” the Blackbird said, walking back over towards a shimmering purple door in the back of the room. “You will experience hardships, just like everyone does. But it is an opportunity, and it is normal. It is a life that you can live free of fear. A life that is your own, not somebody else’s.”

Then Calvin was walking over towards him, and he was unable to move. Calvin’s face was stoic, but his eyes betrayed his concern. He reached out and put a hand on the back of Adam’s head. It was warm.

— - —

Olivia stepped through the door and was abruptly hit in the face with a blast of salty water. She stumbled sideways and opened her eyes, and realized she’d very nearly walked into the sea off the edge of the ship she was now standing on. Ship was perhaps not the right term - the vessel she had appeared on was a yacht. Overhead the skies were blue and cloudless, and the seas around her were generally calm.

She walked towards the center of the deck, where an easel was set up and a rack of different art supplies sat next to it. She moved to stand in front of it and saw it was a painting, half completed, of the horizon in front of her. In the painting the sun was hanging low in the sky. She leaned in and saw the sun in the painting was moving, slowly sinking below the horizon. As it did, the completed half of the image grew dark, and its sky filled with purples and blues.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

She stepped back, and noticed the Blackbird standing nearby, casually gazing off the side of the ship towards a beach nearby.

“Where is this?” she asked.

“Wherever you want it to be, I believe,” he said, idly drumming his fingers on the rail of the ship. “In this world, this ship is yours. That easel and those paints are yours. You have nothing to worry about except the easel, and the sea. All the time you need.”

Olivia snorted. “You think I’d be convinced with a nice boat and some new paints?”

The Blackbird looked back at her and smiled. “No, I really didn’t.”

She heard another sound from behind her - somebody climbing steps. She turned around to find a man emerging from below deck. He had dark, rich skin and long hair in thick braids. He was wearing white shorts and little else, and the definition in his musculature could have cut diamond. When she saw him, Olivia gasped.

“Tevin,” she said, her voice catching. “I don’t- I don’t understand, how?”

The world froze. The Blackbird walked up behind her and beheld the man for a moment.

“I had wondered about you, Olivia. For all your passion you never seemed to show any kind of true emotion. Nothing raw or real.” She looked at him and he grinned. “Yes, I’ve been watching you for a long time. I saw this coming, more or less, and long ago decided to keep tabs on those of you who might be involved.”

He gestured at the man coming up the stairs. “This, though, surprised me. I was really amazed at how well you kept it hidden, even from the people who knew you best. But what would the Incredible Ivory be without her Excellent Ebony, eh?” He laughed. “I get now why the name wouldn’t stick. That’s ok, I’ve had my fair share as well.”

The Blackbird turned back towards the sea. “In this world, the boat and the paints are yours, and so is Tevin Laredo. There is no Foundation raid on your anartist community, and you don’t accidentally turn him into glass while drawing up that wave of fire to dissuade your pursuers.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""” He glanced at her as her face turned white. “Yes, even that. The All-Seeing Eye of the Foundation doesn’t miss much, and it certainly didn’t miss that. I imagine it must have been horrible, really. I understand your pain - I too have made terrible choices with unintended outcomes that I have had to live with.”

He sat down in a deck chair and produced a glass from inside his coat, filling it with a flask also from inside his coat. He took a drink and sighed, leaning back in the chair.

“In this world, Olivia, you don’t have to make that terrible choice. There is no accident. You and he get to stay on this ship and go where you want to go, and see everything you want to see. There is no limit to your horizons here.”

Olivia tried to turn away, but tears were already streaming down her face. The Blackbird took another drink.

“Wouldn’t that be nicer?”

— - —

Calvin stepped out into a grassy field in the middle of the woods. The air was crisp and a thin layer of dew sparkled across the grass in the light of a rising sun. He took a few steps and gauged his surroundings, then sighed. He knew where he was.

The Blackbird appeared beside him, looking down the small slow of a hill they stood on towards a small lake set on the edge of the woods. For a moment, they didn’t speak.

“This is a strange choice,” Calvin finally said.

The Blackbird looked sideways at him. “What makes you say that?”

Calvin shrugged. “I’ve been here before. I know how it goes.”

The Blackbird tutted. “Now, that’s not true. You know how it goes from a single perspective, the one you had that day in the woods-”

Calvin raised an eyebrow.

“-but this world, this is the one you always wanted. The one where you have a chance to save your mother.”

They watched as a young Calvin and his mother came into view through the trees. As they came across the side of the lake, a body appeared in the water, floating up from some dark depth below.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Then another, and another, and suddenly there were hundred of bodies coating the surface of the water like a slime. As they appeared, Calvin’s mother stopped and turned, and she began walking towards the lake. Young Calvin stood unmoving behind her.

“You had all this time,” the Blackbird continued, “all this time to run down and stop her. But you didn’t, because you were a boy and you were scared. Now, though, you have all the time in the-”

He stopped. Staring back at the two of them, right into Calvin’s eyes, was young Calvin. There was a look of knowing there that he recognized as his own, a look of understanding about what had come before and what would happen next. The young man looked back at his mother, and then back at the treeline. Standing there, amidst the brush and the limbs, was a cloaked figure holding a silver canister. Calvin began walking towards them.

The Blackbird recoiled at the sight. “You!?” his voice cracked and Calvin could hear something unnatural beneath his tone. “You did this?”

Calvin reached the figure and took the canister. The figure held a single finger up to their lips.

“This is not what you think it is,” the figure said. “Take it and see.”

Calvin opened the canister and dumped the contents out into his hand. It was a pair of wire-framed glasses, with thin golden runes marked along its edges. Near the back of one of the earpieces was a name, inlaid in black. A. Shaw. Calvin held them up and they glittered in the light of the rising sun.

“What are you doing?!” the Blackbird cried from across the meadow. “All of our endeavours laid to waste, and nothing but panic and uselessness from all of you. At least I was trying to fix the problem. I was trying to help. I wanted to make them happy, even if this one can’t be satisfied.”

Calvin paused. “You showed me this place, didn’t you? I imagine you showed the other two something similar. What - their ideal world, or something?” He considered this.""")

The Blackbird sank his thumb into the bridge of his nose. “Because those two want things that can be achieved reasonably. You, on the other hand, are a violent demagogue appealing to their baser instincts. They’ve both experienced hardships - because all people experience hardships. You and your ilk just pointed the finger at the Foundation and gave them an outlet for their hate. I was trying to offer them something better. But all you want is to kill, and all because of this moment, right here.”

He gestured towards the water. “Do you see that? Your own mother, walking off to meet a terrible fate. Your entire life would change, made infinitely better by your non-involvement in these affairs. You have the choice, and you’re still choosing violence. What does that make you?”

Calvin looked back down at the glasses, and after a moment he put them on.

“I don’t know,” he said. “Let’s see about you.”

When he looked back up through the slightly blue-tinted lenses, the meadow and the lake and the woods were still there. However, instead of the Blackbird there now stood a towering monstrosity, some horrific psuedo-avian creature with dead eyes and fetid, rotting flesh. He could see through its thin, matted feathers to within, where a swirling mass of faces howled and cursed, each pressed up against the sides of their container as if it was near to burst. When the creature opened its foul beak to speak, he could hear the Blackbird’s voice echoed over infinitely many incarnations of itself, a sinister cacophony of misery and pain.

“I offered you a life,” the creature said. “I offered you freedom. I offered you your mother.”

Calvin shook his head. “No. That’s not my mother.” He looked down at young Calvin, who was watching him closely. “She’s his. My mother died a long time ago, because of abominations just like you.”

“You’re a fool,” the Blackbird cawed. “It doesn’t matter.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" I don’t have to make you happy - you’re already here, and I don’t have to stay.”

The sky began to turn purple again, and Calvin smelled ozone. From behind him, the figure lay a hand on his shoulder.

“Turn the canister over again,” it said. “Quickly.”

Calvin did, and sliding out from within it was a long fiberglass fishing rod. It was bright pink, with the words “Dr. Wondertainment’s Interdimensional Line and Lure” emblazoned on the side. Behind it was something else, and at the sight of it Calvin grinned. It was plain white wiffle-ball bat with a taped handle and the words “bird-b-gone by dado” written on it in black marker.

He took the rod in one hand and, rearing back, cast it out towards the Blackbird. Out from its end came a brilliant white shimmering line that arced across the meadow and sank into the Blackbird’s flesh. The line went taught, and Calvin gave one last look to the boy standing by the lake before the world turned purple and they disappeared.

When he opened his eyes, Calvin was standing on the deck of a wrecked and ruined ship. A cavernous hole had opened in the middle of it, and peering below he could see no visible bottom. A moment later, the Blackbird fell from the sky behind him and crashed onto the ship with a wet crunching sound.

“Wha-” the creature said, fumbling up onto its wings and talons, “what is this? Where are we? This isn’t where we were supposed to-”

It was stopped suddenly by the sound of a cash register as Calvin swung the wiffle-ball bat sideway and struck the Blackbird in its mottled face. The impact point erupted in feathers and the creature howled and roared. It turned to bite at the fishing line that was now stuck in its back, but before it could reach it Calvin had come around again with the bat, each time causing the Blackbird to burst with feathers and gore and the sound of cash registers.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

The Blackbird spread its wings and took off, and Calvin held tightly to the end of the line as he was pulled up into a purple sky. When the haze cleared they were in a building - a Foundation site, it seemed - surrounded by chaos. Klaxons were blaring and the red lights of breach alarms pulsed rapidly in the giant antechamber they were standing in. A great many white-coated persons were scrambling out of a hallway where, behind them, there came a roaring sound. The Blackbird stared in the direction of the sound, and then its eyes grew suddenly very wide.

“Oh fuck me,” it said.

Bursting out of the hallway came the reptilian monstrosity they had seen in Adam’s village, only smaller and covered in razor sharp blades. It was different, Calvin noticed, but the eyes gave it away. The creatures roared and hissed, and when it turned he could see a man standing on its back, screaming and laughing.

As the Blackbird hesitated, Calvin crossed the room and struck it again with the bat, and then again, and then several times in quick succession. Each time, more and more feathers burst from its hide and the swirling mass of souls within it shouted and recoiled. As the reptilian creature came towards them, rows of teeth clashing together, the Blackbird beat its wings backwards pulling both of them away into the ether.

Calvin crashed into the dirt, and not far away he heard the Blackbird do the same. When he stood up he saw that they were standing in what might have once been a field of grass, but the vegetation had long since died off. In fact, he realized with some morbid amazement, it didn’t seem like there was anything alive at all except for the two of them. The sky was overcast and there was a storm rolling by a distance away, but they heard no birds, no insects, and nothing man-made.

He was distracted momentarily when a drone buzzed by overhead, its motor the only sound to pierce the silence except for a light wind.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" When he turned back the Blackbird was upon him, beak pecking feverishly down at where he had been standing. He scrambled sideways and pulled himself steady on the fishing line, then brought the bat around with him and beat the Blackbird in the side of the beak with it. The beak cracked and splintered and the monster howled, but it pressed on - each time growing closer and closer to Calvin.

Then there was a flash of light on the horizon. They both stopped to look, and in the far north a towering mushroom cloud was forming, a fireball that stretched into the heavens. They watched it rise and rise, and then saw with horror an approaching wall of heat and death. The Blackbird took two steps and then leapt into the sky, and they were gone again.

They did not land immediately. As Calvin clung to the rod for dear life, he saw images of places as they passed. He saw a dark facility where three girls watched them with blind eyes as he came in and out of their existence. He saw a sky with seven moons and an arched golden gateway. He saw a Foundation site covered in snow - not one he was familiar with - with a multitude of doctors pouring out of it. He heard a piercing screech, then a blast of blue light, and then the site was gone.

Each vision he passed, he began to notice faces. They were faint at first, growing more clear every time he came by another world. They were closer to him, more in focus. They were a girl - always slightly different, but the same girl each time. They watched him intently, each one looking as if they were about to speak. Then, one of them was holding up a hand with five fingers. The next had four. Then three. Two. One.

The last girl held out her hand, and Calvin reached for it. They touched, and then immediately the swirling purple haze subsided and they crashed into a hard concrete floor.

The first thing Calvin noticed was pressure. Something nearby was exerting a lot of it, and he felt a considerable effort to even breathe.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" As he stood up and looked around, he noticed the source: a massive, immensely complicated machine comprised of several concentric rings, within which was a dark, swirling mass of dust and debris. He looked up and saw that they were in the bottom of shaft he could not see the top of. The walls were lined with machines and panels, hoses and brackets, banks of lights that extended upwards to those dizzying heights.

And then he saw the Blackbird, rising up from a heap in front of the machine in the middle of the chamber, stretching its wings and screaming furiously. Its eyes came back down and settled on the only other person in the room, a thin girl with dark hair wearing a silver circlet etched with a small black crown around her head. She took one nervous step back as the creature hissed at her.

“Alison?” it asked, rage burning in its sockets. “What are you doing? Why are you here?”

“I’ve had enough, Mort,” she yelled, barely audible over the din of the machine in front of them. “This isn’t right. None of this is right.”

The Blackbird growled and roared. “What do you mean, ‘isn’t right’? How do you all not understand this? I can offer you anything you want. A life worth living, a death worth dying, and anything in between. You could be a god, Alison.”

She shook her head. “No. No, it’s not natural. I can’t keep doing this.”

The Blackbird reared up in front of her. “Natural? Death is natural. Misery is natural. What I offer is an escape - an existence that isn’t a horror. What else could you possibly want?”

She didn’t respond. The massive creature cawed loudly and beat its wings down at her.

“I’m sorry Alison,” it said, its tone now cold and flat, “but I’m afraid you no longer have a choice. I am the Black King. You can do nothing to stop me.”

“No,” she said, her hand falling back to a panel near her. “But he can.”

She turned a key and pulled a thick black handle and the lights around the room turned red and began to strobe in unison.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Behind the Blackbird the massive machine began to unfold, the rings pulling backwards and exposing the room to the massive pressure within. The Blackbird steadied itself and laughed.

“Really, Alison? Have you not learned anything? There are infinitely many of me in here - killing any one of me will do nothing.”

Calvin came up beside her, bat in hand. He tapped it twice against his shoe.

“Not infinite,” he said. “Not quite.”

With a running start, Calvin crossed the room and took aim at the Blackbird’s center, striking it dead even with a solid, resounding crack. The creature heaved and creaked, and stumbled backwards into the swirling cloud of dust. It grabbed the edges of the machine with its talons and gripped, causing the metal to bend and twist. The ground beneath them began to shake and buckle, and the steel walls of the shaft began to groan.

Then, with a soft rush of air, the cloud of dust vanished. In its place was a humanoid figure, solid black and unmoving. The air around it distorted heavily, and in the place of the cloud of dust was a red glow. The sound of creaking metal and groaning earth faded, and the figure inside the machine looked up. Alison grabbed Calvin’s arm and pulled him behind a raised platform.

The room began to vibrate, and through the sound Calvin could hear something like a voice, tinny and metallic, echoing through the air around them.

“Overseer…” the voice said, “you are… an Overseer?”

“Yes!” the Blackbird screeched. “Release me!”

The figure unfolded itself and was now hanging in the air, standing straight up.

“Crimes… immeasurable crimes.”

“What crime?” the Blackbird cried. “The only thing I’ve done is offer an escape! A way out!”

The figure extended an open hand.

“No,” it said, “this is the only way out.”

It closed its hand, and the Blackbird seized. There was another rush of air, and Calvin could feel the breath being pulled from his chest.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He leaned around the platform just in time to see the Blackbird pulled into a single superheated point and sizzle out of existence. The room began to shake violently, and Alison reached up and hit the handle on the platform. The lights began to flash again, and the machine started spooling up. A few moments later, as they sat huddled behind the platform, the air settled and the roar subsided.

Calvin took a deep breath and coughed. “What… what was that?”

The girl called Alison stood up gingerly. She held out a hand to Calvin and he did the same.

“That being is one of near unparalleled power,” she said, he hand rubbing a spot on her neck. “It took me a long time to find it, but I had been searching for it for years. This is the only reality where this being exists, so you had to come here.” She cracked her neck. “We’re sorry for the inconvenience.”

Calvin nodded slowly. “Who are you?”

She smiled. “My name is Alison. The Foundation has a different name for me, for all of us, but that’s neither here nor there. We caught wind of what you were doing and realized this was our chance to undo the damage he had done.”

Calvin cocked his head to the side. “Damage?”

She rubbed her wrist. “When the Blackbird found us we thought we had a sort of kinship with him. He-” she hesitated. “I don’t think he was evil, but there were so many Mortimers in there that it’s hard to say who you’d be talking to at any given time. He could see injustice, I think, but aside from his own power to escape it he didn’t ever seem to care enough to do anything about it. I think he enjoyed his own existence too much.”

Calvin nodded and then looked back to the humming machine. “I don’t know how to get back.”

Alison gestured at the fishing rod laying on the ground. “If you cast that out, another Black Queen will catch it and pull you in.”

He frowned. “You mentioned the Foundation. Does it exist in this world? Do you know anything about the Overseers?”

She laughed. “It did.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" They did too, a long time ago. But this-” she gestured towards the machine, “-this killed everybody a long time ago. There’s nobody left here, now. Just me, and just to make sure this machine keeps running.”

Calvin nodded and picked up the rod. He turned away from her and then stopped.

“Do you know what he showed them?” he asked. “The two other people I was with?”

Alison grimaced. “I do.”

“What was it?”

She shook her head. “I can’t tell you that - just that taking them from where they are right now would be a cruelty you’d be doing to them.”

Calvin didn’t respond. Instead, he pulled the rod back and cast it into the sky. It caught somewhere up above him, and the world went purple.

They stood on the tarmac of a small airport as a plane taxied up to them. When it stopped and the stairs descended, Sylvester Sloan emerged from within.

He eyed them over carefully. Finishing his assessment, he loudly harrumphed.

“You three look like shit,” he said.

He was right. Adam stood uncomfortably apart from the other two, his eyes glassy and downcast and his shoulders hunched slightly. He shivered even despite the warm winds blowing out of the badlands behind them. Olivia was white as a sheet - the skin around her eyes tight and her breathing shallow. Calvin stood in front of them, his hands bandaged and several large bruises forming over his neck and face. The broken fishing rod was clutched in his hand; Olivia’s eyes would occasionally flash over towards it, and her breathing would become shallow again.

Calvin nodded curtly. Sloan frowned, and without another word ushered the three of them onto the plane. Moments later, they were away.



ELSEWHERE

Aaron Siegel stood in an elevator, quickly and quietly descending down a long shaft towards a complex aperture suspended over a shallow pool of red fluid. The elevator came to a halt, and he stepped out onto the platform in front of him.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He glanced down at the figures lying in the pool, and then crossed over to a control panel.

He entered a command into the panel, and below him the red liquid began to drain away. The four figures, still obscured by darkness, were lifted up from the pool by long metal arms that whirred quietly as they worked. They carried metallic plates, long lengths of wire and tubing, and racks of ammunition over to the figures, across whom glowing lines of superheated metal appeared as they squirmed silently. Aaron watched the entire process until it was finished, and the four figures were lifted up to the platform and deposited.

“Can you hear me?” Aaron said.

The foremost figure, a bald humanoid male in flexible armor, nodded. “We do.”

“There are three agents of the Insurgency who had gotten their hands on powerful and valuable artifacts,” Aaron said quickly. “They have already killed seven of the other Overseers. Myself, the Nazarene, and the Kid are protected. The Ambassador has gone missing, and will likely be their next target.” He typed something into the control panel. “These are his last known coordinates.”

“What is the mission?” another figure asked. This one was short and lean - clearly feminine, with cropped hair.

“Find these three,” Aaron said, “if you can, bring them to me. If they resist, kill them. They are carrying two very valuable artifacts - a journal and a spear. Bring me the artifacts.”

He turned over his shoulder. Behind him was a screen - black, with a dark grey circle and three arrows spinning slowly around a single red, glowing point. When Aaron acknowledged it, the red spot began glowing brighter.

“Show them,” he said, his voice hoarse. “Show them where he’s at. Find him.”

The red spot blinked twice and disappeared. He turned back to the humanoids in front of him.

“Go now Irantu, Munru, Nanku, Onru,” he said. “Find the Insurgents. Bring me the artifacts. Be my Red Right Hand.”

Persian male, Iranian/Armenian ancestry. French heritage. Appears to be in his early-thirties. Some sources have provided records indicating that O5-4 was, in his youth, French actor Jean Lemieux Betrand, born Jean Ebrahimi. Since most evidence of O5-4's exploits were apparently destroyed shortly after his appointment to the Overseer Council, little is known about his professional career.

Commonly called "The Ambassador", O5-4 is called to action whenever the Council needs a pretty face. Often described as being incredibly attractive and anomalously charismatic, he has acted as the Foundation's salesman whenever required. Sources indicate he was first tasked with drawing American attention away from Mexico during the Second World War, likely due to the severe anomalous activity taking place there at the same time.

Despite being well-spoken and appearing generally well-educated, O5-4 is not an academic, nor is he particularly interested in the prospect of managing an organization. He is well known for delegating any duties he might accrue, in order to maintain as little responsibility as possible. This lackadaisical attitude towards leadership was manipulated by O5-7, who convinced the Ambassador to give her an unofficial "automatic vote" for anything she might support.

## LOYALTIES

BEFORE

Thirteen chairs with thirteen occupants sat around a long, ovular table in a cavernous chamber deep beneath the earth. On the walls around them were screens, many of which were displaying vital statistical information of some relevance and others which were live feeds of hallways, courtyards, laboratories and holding cells. These screens were ignored, though, in favor of something lying in the center of the long table. Something long and sleek, with a dark wooden shaft and an etched steel spearhead.

“Well I’ll be damned,” the American said, leaning in to look at it closer.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “You actually got it done.”

The Outsider stood from her seat and pulled out a packet of papers. “Yes, well, with no shortage of effort there are plenty of things you can accomplish.”

Blackbird smiled from his seat near the end of the table. “Plenty of things, yes. Great and terrible things. The Egyptians murdered thousands to build their pyramids.”

“I believe the Pyramids were actually built by Elvis and Tupac,” the Accountant said, “though I may be confusing that with Atlantis.”

They all laughed.

“W-what does it do?” the Lesser said.

An uncomfortable nothingness at the end of the table stirred, causing the air to chill suddenly. A voice came out of it, one quiet but intense and difficult to listen to.

“This is the Spear of the Non-Believer,” the Other Overseer said, “the godless lance of Old King Sarrus.” The spectral horror hummed softly. “Fascinating.”

The Outsider came around the table, handing each of them folders out of her packet of information. “To answer your question, the short answer is ‘probably a lot’. The longer answer is that we’re not sure. Ever since we contained the last of the four great demons and gained access to Apollyon’s tomb, we’ve been studying the texts found there to learn more about this spear. It obviously had some importance to the king, or else it wouldn’t have been where it was and it wouldn’t have cost so much blood to get to it.”

She pulled out a remote and flashed it at the largest monitor in the room, one that hung on the far wall. It showed the interior of a tomb, dusty and dark, with the spear hanging by silver chain over a large, stone sarcophagus. The next image was text from a book written in a language few of them recognized.

“Is that Daeva?” the Blackbird said bemusedly. “Written in shorthand, so not by a Daevite. Where was this?”

“In the tomb,” the Outsider said.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “Based on information we’ve gathered from these books, it’s likely that these passages were written by either Daevite captives, or slaves, or were stolen from Daevite libraries. Why they were buried with Apollyon, I’m not sure. However, there are several tombs in this collection that speak about that spear directly, indicating that it predates that kingdom by centuries and may even predate the Daevites. A lack of written historical records beyond that point would make it difficult to narrow down, but we have reason to believe that even to these ancient civilizations, it was considered a legendary weapon.”

The Lesser rapped his knuckles on the table in frustration. “I understand all of that, but I want a short answer. Why is this important and why did we spend so many disposables on obtaining it?”

The American shot him a look. “It kills gods, Baron. If you throw it at a god, that god will die.” He waved his hands around in the air. “Poof. Just like that.”

The Lesser’s face scrunched up uncomfortably. “That’s just preposterous. You can’t kill gods.”

“Oh yes,” the Other Overseer said calmly, “you certainly can. It is a remarkably difficult feat, accomplished by only a handful throughout all of time, but there have been terribly powerful beings consigned to oblivion before.”

The Archivist began flipping through a book on the desk in front of her quickly. “Yes, if my records are accurate, which they likely are since they d-did not have to be translated and were not sitting in a cave-” the Outsider shot her a blistering look -”there are legends going back th-thousands of years, maybe more, about different weapons that could k-kill gods. Usually sword, arrows, that sort of thing. Most have either been confirmed to be fakes, or l-lost to antiquity, but perhaps the most enduring l-legend is this one. The Spear. I-in fact, there have not been any other s-such stories about s-such powerful weapons in all of m-modern history.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

“Well,” the Other Overseer said with a light lilting to its response, “there was one.” At the other end of the long table, the figure sitting in shadow at its head shifted in its seat.

“Yes, Diane, thank you,” the Outsider said, annoyed. “One of the oldest legends regarding the spear involved Lucifer, the figure from Christian mythology. In that story-” she clicked the remote again, and the next image was what could very tenuously be called a book, “-when God smote Lucifer a shard of his iron crown fell to the earth with him and was found by Cain. The same story details how Cain used the shard to kill Abel, not a rock, and that he crafted the spear out of his brother’s bones once he realized its terrible power.”

The table was silent for a moment.

“What a crock of shit,” the Liar said, kicking their feet up onto the tabletop and cackling. “I know bullshit when I see it, and that-” they gestured at the screen “-is bullshit.”

“Now now,” a sickly sweet voice danced across the table, “you know how much Mr. Siegel doesn’t like people putting their feet up on the table now, honey. We’ve been over this before.”

The Liar pulled their feet back off quickly. “Sorry, ma’am.”

Green leaned forward into the light, a narrow pair of rectangular spectacles perched on the end of her nose. “Oh, it’s no worry. I just don’t want anyone getting distracted today, when we have such important work to do.” She looked across to the American. “Rufus. Do you have anywhere we can put this where nobody will be able to get to it?”

The American shrugged. “I mean, no. Ain’t got anywhere you can just shove things where there won’t also be unassociated persons digging around. Can we not just keep it here?”

Green shook her head. “No, here won’t do. We need to put this somewhere close enough that we can get to it if we need it, but far enough away that it will never be used against us.” She tapped a finger against her chin. “Anyone have any ideas?”

The room was silent again. She sighed.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

“What about you, Mr. Roboto?” she seemed to say to nobody specific. Suddenly the screens in the room blackened, and each was replaced by a dark grey circle and arrows with a pulsing red spot at its center. “You have anywhere we can keep this?” she said.

You are asking if I know of a location more secure than the one you are currently sitting in, the display read. The answer is no. There is no location more secure than this one.

Green huffed. “Well there has to be somewhere, right? Is there nowhere out there we can-”

She was silenced suddenly by the ringing of a phone at the far end of the table. The figure in the shadows there looked down towards it, and on the third ring extended a hand and picked up the receiver. They spoke in hushed tones for a moment, and then sat the receiver back down. The table watched the figure silently.

“Sophia will take it away,” the Founder said, his voice soft. “She can keep it hidden out of time, with no opportunity for it to be disturbed in any way. He looked down at his watch, and then back up at the table. “For our purposes, you would all do well to keep your distance from this.”

The Ambassador furrowed his brow, confused. “One moment sir, if I might. L'Américain says this is a spear for killing gods, yes? Why then would it be any danger to us? We are not gods, no?”

The Founder smiled gently. “Jean, you give yourself too little credit.” He looked back down the table. “Diane, Rufus, Mortimer. Assign as many of your assets as you feel comfortable to Donna’s team at the Apollyon site. Sophia,” he looked at the figure in the shadows just beside him, who did not move, “take this away. Find somewhere to keep it safe. I trust you.”

The figure flickered slightly, and then both it and the spear were gone, and the table in unison realized it had never been there at all.



NOW

The hum of the jet’s engines were the only sound that filled the cabin as Sylvester Sloan’s plane cruised through the skies.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He and Calvin sat at a table together near the front of the plane; they had been talking a moment before, but now they sat staring at a television mounted at the front of the cabin. The sound was off but the message was clear: the newsreel read “French billionaire Jean Lemieux Betrand cancels appearance at Jove Festival in South Africa, citing security concerns.”

Olivia was watching too. Her complexion had not improved much, but her eyes were focused. “Jean Betrand. That’s the Ambassador, isn’t it?” She squinted at the screen. “Is he always so… public?”

“That’s what he does,” Sloan growled. “The pretty face of the Foundation’s PR efforts. Not really one to miss a party, though.” He scratched his chin. “Something must be up.”

Suddenly the light on the cabin phone lit up with a soft beeping. Sloan walked over to it and pressed a button.

“Does the Black Moon Howl?” he asked.

“It never stopped,” the voice - a woman’s - replied.

Sloan sighed. “Good evening, Priscilla. What can I help you with?”

The woman on the other end tutted at him. “Have you retrieved our agents?”

Sloan looked back at the three of them, his nose turned up slightly. “Might as well call it that. What do you need?”

“You’ve no doubt seen the news,” she said. “The Ambassador has cancelled his plans for tonight. What you may find interesting is why. Not an hour ago we received a call from him, verified identity and all, and he informed us that he had cancelled his plans because he wants to meet with us to discuss terms.”

Sloan’s steely eyes darkened. “Terms? Terms of what?”

“Surrender,” Norris said. “There are only a few of them left now, and he’s seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. A rat off a sinking ship.”

Sylvester looked at Calvin, who was still staring at the television. “This feels like a trap, Priscilla,” he said slowly. “What is he expecting to gain from this?”

“His life,” she said. “He said he’d gladly stand trial, he just doesn’t want to die.”

Sloan pursed his lips.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “Not surprising, the coward. What’s he willing to offer?”

“Information, and his resignation. He says he can tell us where the All-Seeing Eye is.”

Calvin looked back down towards the phone, and then back at Olivia and Adam. Olivia was staring at him, her face still stricken from her time with the Blackbird. Adam had not looked away from the window since they got on the plane. Calvin sighed.

“Who does he want to talk to?” he asked.

Norris scoffed. “Myself, of course. As our chief diplomat, I alone have the authority to parlay with him.”

“More like she’d like to get him alone and fuck him,” Sloan whispered, his voice little more than a growl.

“You’ll need a security detail,” Calvin said. “You’ll need to move quickly.”

“I’m not an amateur, Mr. Lucien,” she scoffed. “I’ll not be told how to do my job-”

“I still don’t like it,” Sloan interrupted. “You have no idea what his intentions are.”

“Of course not - because we haven’t met yet, Sylvester. That’s what diplomacy is for. Besides that, the decision has already been made. I will go to meet him tonight and bring him back to Delta for further questioning. Once we’ve gotten what we need from him, we hold onto him until this all blows over and then he’ll be free to go.”

“The decision has been made?” Sloan barked.

“Yes, Sylvester. We called a vote shortly after he contacted us. If you wanted to participate, you shouldn’t have run off on your own courier mission when we could have sent a thank you card and a hot-air balloon to accomplish the same thing. You can’t just leave whenever you want, we are at war, after all.”

The grinding of Sloan’s teeth was pronounced. “Where is this exchange taking place?”

“O. R. Tambo International,” she responded. “Why, you’re not thinking of-”

Sloan dropped the phone back on the cradle and sighed. “Priscilla is a skilled diplomat, but this is above her abilities, I’m afraid. Betrand is notoriously anomalously charismatic.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" I wasn’t even joking about her wanting to fuck him, either. She’s a good talker, but not what I would call clever or self-aware.”

“What do you want to do?” Calvin said.

He groaned. “I don’t know. Your two compatriots there are in no shape to be going back out there. I don’t want Priscilla handling this alone, so I need to go and intercept her before anything happens. You,” he paused. “I don’t know where you’re at right now. Are you alright?”

Calvin shrugged. “I’ve been worse.”

“Then you can come with me. We’ll land at Tambo and depart, and I’ll send these two back to Delta and out of harm’s way. Agreed?”

Calvin nodded. “Agreed.”

Hours later, and after a bout of fitful sleep, they landed in Johannesburg with little fanfare. As they prepared to disembark, Sloan pointed towards another plane sitting on the far end of the tarmac. The lettering on the side bore the words “Distant Horizons Airlines”.

“That’s a Foundation front,” he said. “He’s here.”

Calvin gathered his things and moved to leave, then hesitated. He turned back towards Olivia and Adam, both of whom were watched him. Their faces were sullen.

“Stay here,” he said. “I’ll come back for you once this is over.”

Olivia nodded, but Adam barely moved. His eyes were locked on Calvin’s face, and there was an intensity there that Calvin didn’t know how to respond to. Instead he nodded in response, and left the plane.

He and Sloan crossed the tarmac towards the airport, where a small group of individuals Calvin identified as Insurgency operatives were waiting for them by a side door. As they approached, Sloan pulled a silver ring out of his pocket and held it up for them to see. Acknowledging the identification, the agents pulled the doors open and accompanied them inside. They proceeded down several long hallways until one agent ushered them into a side door.

The room beyond was small - likely a meeting room for airport employees.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Sitting at the table was a suddenly extremely aggravated Priscilla Norris, as well as a man in a clean, crisp tan blazer with a light blue shirt and dark blue tan slacks. As they entered the man stood and smiled, though when he caught Calvin’s gaze he hesitated. Nobody else seemed to notice, and the man played it off quickly.

“Sylvester,” Norris said, seething. “What are you doing here?”

Sloan smiled as he extended his hand towards the man in the tan jacket. “Enjoying the weather, Priscilla. I haven’t been this far south in ages; it’s good for my old, flappy skin.” He turned to the man and took his hand. “Sylvester Sloan, a pleasure.”

The man’s smile was striking, Calvin noticed. He was unusually handsome, with dark hair pulled back into a short bun behind his head and a rich complexion with no blemishes to speak of. His eyes were a dark green, and when he laughed it sounded like music and falling water.

“Jean Betrand, the pleasure is all mine,” the man said. “Thank you for coming so far to meet with me, Mr. Sloan. I was just telling Ms. Norris that I hope I have not inconvenienced you too terribly.”

Sloan waved him off. Calvin watched him, and realized that despite the performance he was putting on, Sylvester was very carefully watching the windows and listening.

“It is no problem at all, of course.” Sloan gestured back towards Calvin, who bowed slightly. “You’re familiar with my colleague, Calvin Lucien?”

Betrand’s face froze for an instant before relaxing back into its natural position. “Yes, yes, the man hunting Overseers.” He extended a hand to Calvin as well, who shook it. “You have really shaken things to their core, Mr. Lucien.”

Calvin didn’t respond, but they shared a look that spoke volumes of the tension in the room. Betrand motioned for them all to sit, and they did.

“I will be as concise as I can,” he said, “because I do have a tendency to rattle on. Your actions, Mr. Lucien, have destabilized the Foundation.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" There are now crucial functions that were once performed by my colleagues that are no longer active. In the past, I would have reached out to Green or Rufus for their wisdom in these trying times, but they are also absent.” He adjusted his jacket slightly. “That’s why I’ve come to you. I am a realist, and despite my years of service to the Foundation’s goals I value my own longevity over any ideology. Besides, by the look of things your ideology is winning out against theirs. Perhaps it is time to begin reconsidering.”

“Besides this,” he continued, “I possess what you might call an acute ability to… feel things. People, I can read people easily. It is no problem. Even large groups, I feel very comfortable around, because I know how they are feeling. This, though, is much different. There is something massive moving within the Foundation, something very powerful. This power is radiating out from Overwatch Command, and it grows stronger everyday.”

Calvin thought, then, about the presence he had felt in the warehouse, and in the spire. Something large looking down on him like he might look at a dust mite. “The Founder,” Calvin said. “Aaron Siegel.”

Betrand looked at him and nodded slowly. “This is most likely. I am a single man, and while I may be the Ambassador of the Foundation, I am not eager to stand between this power and its goal. Instead, I would like to see it snuffed out. From what I understand, you are in possession of tools capable of doing this.”

He laid his hands palms up on the table. “Here is what I offer. I know the location of the Overwatch Command, as well as many other Foundation black sites. I can show you where they are hidden. I have knowledge, practical knowledge about the Foundation that you might find useful. Once this is over, perhaps your organization will need assistance in cleaning up the mess that has been made. I have contacts in many organizations, and am well known. A valuable resource.”

Norris nodded.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “Yes, we would eagerly accept your services, Jean.”

Betrand looked at her, and his eyes flashed for a moment. Calvin looked around and realized that, once again, he seemed to be the only one who noticed it. He caught Betrand looking at him from the corner of his eye, seemingly surprised about something. Norris, however, carried on.

“We should get you out of here, and to safety. There is no telling what sort of erratic and dangerous response the Foundation might-”

As if on cue, they heard someone shout in the distance. This was followed by more voices, and then a line of ripping bullets fired from some sort of powerful automatic weapon. Everyone in the room stood suddenly as Norris’ security team filed out into the hallway. More gunshots filled the air. When Calvin looked back, he saw that Betrand had gone pale.

“That’s them,” he said. “They’ve come for me. God, they’re going to kill me.”

“I don’t think so,” Sloan said, grabbing the man by his jacket and pulling him into the hall. Norris followed behind them and then Calvin. As they passed, Sloan addressed Norris’ detail.

“If you see any hostiles, put them down,” he growled. “We’ll deal with the fallout later.”

They scampered down another long hallway until it opened up into a cafeteria. Employees of the airport were milling about, but the group quickly gathered their attention. Sloan pushed Betrand forward as more gunshots echoed through the hall behind them. Noticing this, the people in the cafeteria began to run for the exits, eager to escape the danger. Norris, Calvin, Sloan, and Betrand fell in with this group and together they made their way out towards the terminal.

They exited out into a large lobby, where more people - likely passengers - were now heading towards the exits. Sloan pointed towards a set of gates, past which was his jet sitting on the tarmac. As they took off running for the door at the far end of the airport, there was an explosion behind them.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

When Calvin turned to look through the dust and debris, he saw four figures emerging from the smoke. They were human, but something about them was otherworldly and uncanny. The lead was a tall male with a shaved head and heavy body armor. One of the two females carried a lit flamethrower, while the other carried a long rifle. The other male was carrying what appeared to be a minigun fed by a long chain of bullets from a pack on his back. The four of them eyed Calvin in unison, and began running for him.

“Oh fuck,” Calvin said, turning and sprinting towards the rest of the group. He heard the sound of the roaring minigun and ducked behind a pillar. From behind the group, Insurgency security operatives began flooding out into the lobby, firing openly at the four assailants. Distracted, they turned and engaged the security teams, and Calvin was able come around back behind the group and join them again.

As they ducked and weaved to avoid the spray of bullets, Calvin occasionally caught a glimpse of the carnage taking place behind them. He saw one of the four, a woman, lift an agent into the air and hold her flamethrower up to their face. The larger of the men had pulled a steel support pillar out of the wall and had used it to skewer two other men, who writhed and dangled from it before slumping over and collapsing. A bullet pinged off a metal desk near Calvin, and he saw from a distance the assailant with the long rifle, slowly walking towards them and firing. He looked over towards the other three, who were preparing to take off again.

“Down!” he hissed. “Stay down!”

Sloan ducked beneath a table, but Betrand stumbled and fell over a row of chairs. As he did, Norris chirped and stood to assist him. Calvin heard the pop from the rifle and the pop from her skull simultaneously, as Norris’ consciousness was reduced to a pink vapor.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Sloan cried out as he was sprayed with the gurgling remains of Norris’ grey matter, and a stooped Calvin had to pull him out from under the table. The three of them crawled towards the door as more bullets buzzed overhead.

When they reached the exit, Calvin threw open the door and together they ran out onto the tarmac. In the near distance they saw Sloan’s plane pulling onto the runway. They passed under another jet pulled into the gate, only narrowly avoiding the corpse of a headless agent that came crashing down towards them from a now broken window as the four Foundation assassins appeared in the open space where the glass had been. Calvin didn’t look back, but felt himself falling as Sloan nudged him sideway, just as a bullet brushed across his cheek. When he looked back, Sylvester was holding his leg, and blood was pooling up through his pants. The man gasped and looked up at Calvin, and his expression went blank as another bullet burst through his heart.

Another bullet crashed into the tarmac next to him, and Calvin rolled over to grab Betrand, who was curled into a ball on the ground. Calvin could see a dire expression stretched across his features, a speechless fear accompanied by wordless chattering of his lips.

The speakers on the runway all around him began to hiss and crackle. Then, suddenly, a voice echoed out across the airport - child-like and unnatural.

Irantu…

               …not the insurgent…

                                 …bring me the insurgent…

                 Kill the traitor.
Something like a wheeze escaped Betrand’s mouth, and suddenly he was up and trying to scramble away. Behind them, Calvin heard a dull thud as the tallest of the group, the one the voice had called Irantu, landed flat on his feet from three stories up and began to swiftly cross the runway towards Betrand.

“No!” Betrand screamed.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “No! Let me go, please, I beg you, I’ll do whatever you want! Please! Please! Forgive me, please! I don’t want to die!”

The voice cut through the speakers again.
Traitor.

                                                   Traitor.
Betrand fell onto his back and scrambled backwards, away from the armored man who now stood before him. Irantu lifted a foot and brought it down on one of Betrand’s legs, shattering it with a splintering crack. He screamed and grabbed for his leg.

“Please! Please! Irantu, please! Don’t do this! Please! I just wanted to live! I don’t want this!”

Irantu grabbed Betrand by his hair and held his head still with his right hand. With his left, he reached into his belt and produced a lean, black hatchet, holding it out in front of Betrand. At the sight of it, the Overseer began gurgling like an infant. A moment later, Irantu brought the hatchet up and then down into Betrand’s skull with a wet crunch, and then again, splitting it open as Betrand's bloodshot eyes rolled back into his head. Dropping the hatchet, Irantu reached into the gap with both hands and, as easily as a person might open a bag of chips, tore the skull in two. Betrand’s body writhed on the ground autonomically for a few moments longer, before it and the airport grew silent.

Calvin’s breathing was heavy as the man approached him, but the roar of jet engines cut across the quiet. They both turned to see Sloan’s plane lifting into the air at the end of the runway, and Calvin’s heart leapt in his chest. Suddenly, he heard the distinct spooling up of the minigun, and then a long line of screaming lead streaked across the sky, ripping into the plane’s engines. The man holding the minigun held it on the plane with laser precision, and only after the aircraft stalled and fell flaming from the sky did he release the trigger.

A pallid grey horror came over Calvin swiftly as he watched the plane burning at the end of the runway.""")

Unknown age. Unknown gender. Unknown ethnicity. Very little is known about the actual nature of O5-3. Often described by sources as not being human at all, and instead being an artificial intelligence designed to create other artificial intelligences. He has not ever appeared physically outside of Overwatch Command, instead appearing through avatars on screens, and speaking with a digitally constructed voice. The single image a source was able to find of O5-3 is of a very young Korean child in traditional Joseon apparel, which is unsupported by any other claims about the Overseer.

He is supposedly the direct report for Maria Jones, the head of the Foundation's Recordkeeping and Information Security Administration, having seized that authority from The Archivist when those records became digital.

Notably, Foundation AIC units (such as the Alexandra and Thorn units) are incapable of discussing O5-3, despite evidence that information about him accumulates in their databanks as they learn over time.

# CHAPTER XI
## THE ALL SEEING EYE

BEFORE

— - —

The doors to the infirmary crashed open, and Aaron's security detail poured into the hallway. Behind them came the Overseer, in a full on sprint towards the single illuminated room on the floor. His guards flanked the door, and he ran in, only stopping once inside to catch his breath.

There were two other people standing in the room, and one laying on a bed attached to several life-giving machines. The Blackbird and Green were standing next to the bed, upon which was Sophia, the Nazarene. Seeing her, Aaron stumbled over towards the bed. He placed an uncertain palm on her forehead. Her breath was shallow.

"What happened?" he asked, his voice ragged. "What happened to her?"

The Blackbird's face was sad, but Green appeared slightly annoyed. "You know what happened to her, Aaron," she said. "She was hung up with silk nails. She's cursed.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" This is what happens to people who are cursed."

Aaron shook his head. He knew the truth of what she was saying, but he had not believed it would come so quickly. He remembered the first night they had spent together, when she had told him what she was capable of. Dancing through time, she had called it. He had laughed. Then one day she disappeared, and when she returned her wrists were punched through with dark iron nails and her side had been skewered. He had not laughed then.

The nails, though. Felix had known what they were. Something old and dangerous. He had warned about them then - warned about what would happen to her blood. The Fountain could protect them from sickness, but-

Curses? he had said. No, unfortunately not. Curses are an unnatural thing. That is a wound I cannot clean out.

But she had persisted. Her work continued, and the projects she managed flourished, but she would have bouts of weakness and agony that would last for days, then weeks. The last one had stretched on for three months. Felix had tended to her using the treatments the Blackbird had recommended, but it had become evident that her condition was worsening.

“You said that you could prevent this,” Aaron snarled at the Blackbird. “You said your magic would keep this from happening.”

The Blackbird held up his hands. “I made no such promises. I said I could delay the inevitable, but this is the inevitable, Mr. Siegel. She is fortunate to have lasted this long. Those nails were not designed for someone who survived a crucifixion.”

Aaron turned back to her. He felt heat building in his face, something sharp and broken festering in his gut. Sophia’s skin had begun to darken, first along her arms and now creeping up to her chest. Mottled black and grey, like frostbite. They had wrapped them in bandages to keep the seeping down, but the bandages had soaked through.

“How much longer?” he asked.

The Blackbird sighed. “Days, maybe. Hours, more likely.”

Aaron didn’t react.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The room was stuffy and still, the only sound was the clicking and beeping of the machines, the soft rush of air with every assisted breath, and the ticking of a clock on the wall.

“I would be remiss,” the Blackbird said, “if I did not remind you that our previously discussed arrangement could prevent this.”

Aaron stiffened. “That’s not what we’re here to do.”

The Blackbird shrugged. “Maybe not. But the terms of the contract are clear. Stay the hand of death. This-” he gestured down to Sophia’s withering form, “-is death. This is what it looks like.”

“You don’t have long to decide,” Green said, tapping her foot impatiently. “Once she’s gone, she’s gone. There’s no getting her back.”

He felt the heat again. In a flash, he wondered if they had exacerbated her condition to bring him to this point - to force a decision. There had been almost unanimous approval when the contract was first discussed - specifically from those with the most to gain. Green, the Archivist, the Lesser. But Sophia had resisted, and thus so did Aaron. It is not our purpose to live forever, he had said. It’s our purpose to do right by the Foundation.

Easier to do right when there’s no time limit, Green had responded.

He took a deep breath, and then another. He stood up and adjusted his tie. He closed his eyes and focused. Focused.

“Death,” he said in the prepared Latin, “make real your avatar. Appear now.”

The room grew cold and still. The sounds dimmed until all that remained was silence. There was a dark figure in the corner, a grim phantom beyond which was nothingness. Aaron saw the Blackbird shiver, and Green clutch the railing of Sophia’s deathbed.

“Aaron Siegel,” the voice whispered, barely a sound at all. “I would tell you that I am surprised, but man’s convictions have been discarded for less.” The figure cast its empty gaze down on the bed. “A terrible decision awaits you, doesn’t it?”

“Produce the contract,” he said. His voice was hollow.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

There was a rush of air, and something like rattling laughter followed it. The spectre reached into its tattered robes and pulled out a long, black quill. In the air before them, a spitting and shimmering red line appeared, hissing as it burned and smoked. Beneath it appeared the words JAMES AARON SIEGEL, O5-1. Aaron reached out and grabbed the quill from the shadow and dragged its razor tip across his palm. A thick line of blood pooled up in his fist, and he gripped the end of the quill tight until it was full. Then, with a swift flick of his wrist, he scrawled his name across the line. The ink sizzled and burned for a second as it hung there, the only source of light in the room, and then disappeared.

“One more,” the voice said, gesturing down towards Sophia. A stark white face in the shadow grinned. “Thirteen names.”

As it had before with his name, the line appeared again with the words JESU SOPHIA LIGHT, O5-2 beneath it. Aaron reached down and pierced Sophia just above the breast with the end of the quill, where the encroaching rot had not yet touched. Blood jumped into it, and using her hand to hold the pen Aaron traced her name in the air. The ink danced around in the darkness for a moment, then it too disappeared.

Then they were all there, a long line of names and signatures.

There was another rush of air - a mocking laughter, Aaron thought - and then the lights came back up. The figure in the corner was gone, as was the quill. He looked at the spot on his hand where the quill had broken skin and saw nothing. When he looked up, the Blackbird and Green were both looking at him incredulously, and then all three of them looked down at the bed as Sophia began to cough. She brought a hand up to her face and rubbed her eyes, blinking them against the light. She turned to look at Green and the Blackbird, and then again to look at Aaron. When she saw him, her face darkened.

“Oh, Aaron,” she whispered, her voice hoarse. “You didn’t.""")

NOW

— - —

Calvin was drowning. He was adrift in a sea with no surface and no floor, and the dark grey of the abyss surrounding him as far as he could see. Water filled his lungs, his chest, his eyes. He gasped and clawed at his throat, desperate to seize even a single other breath. He screamed silently, and then the water filled him.

He awoke with a start, sitting up quickly and grabbing on to the edge of the platform he had been laying on to steady himself. As he gathered his bearings, he wiped a hand across his face - water, from a leaking pipe above him. He took several deep breaths and his heart began to calm down. He took another few breaths and looked around.

He was sitting on a padded platform, a few feet off the ground. The room he was in was small, with a single door on one wall and a slatted vent overhead. The air coming through the vent was cold, and he shivered instinctively. He felt around and realized his sidearm was missing, but his other belongings were sitting neatly on a small table next to the platform. He stood and picked them up.

The only other thing in the room, he noticed, was a small screen next to the door connected to a speaker. He approached it and bent down to look at it closely. The screen was dark, displaying a slowly spinning grey circle and arrows - the Foundation seal - with a glowing red point at its center. As he drew closer, the red point pulsed. A voice crackled through the speaker - a child’s voice, but the intonation was wrong. The cadence of it was awkward, like it was an approximation of what a child should sound like.

“You’re awake,” the voice said with an eerie tinniness. “You’ve been sleeping for a long time.”

Calvin coughed. “Where am I? What is this?”

“This is where I live,” the voice replied. “My friends brought you here. They brought your friends, too.”

“My-” Calvin’s voice caught in his chest. He remembered the explosion, and the plane falling out of the sky.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “Where are they? What did you do with them?”

“They’re here. You’re all here. I didn’t kill your friends.” A lower bass sound echoed through the walls of his chamber. “Unlike you. You killed my friends.”

Calvin stepped back away from the screen. “Who are you?”

The sound coming through the speaker changed abruptly, and now it played music - a distorted mashup of pop music tracks like a commercial jingle. At the end of the jingle he heard another voice, his own voice, from a conversation between he and Anthony months prior, when they had been trying to track down the location of the Accountant.

”The last three are the really tricky ones,” he heard his own voice say. ”The Founder and the Nazarene are holed up in Site-01, but the Third Overseer, the Kid… well, the writer didn’t seem to know anything about them at all.”

“The Kid. You’re the Third Overseer?” Calvin asked.

The spinning icon began to rotate slightly faster. “I know what you want to do,” the voice said. “You’re here to kill me. You want to kill my Father and my Mother, too. I don’t want you to do that. Mrs. Green says that people who kill like you do are evil.”

The speaker went mute, and on the screen the rotating icon disappeared. Next to him, he heard the lock on the door click. Calvin looked at it for a moment, and then slowly opened the door and stepped outside.

He was standing in a long, dark industrial hallway, lit by dim incandescents hanging from the walls. He could see one end of the hall near him - a panel of lights and switches behind a steel grate. At the other end he could see a bend in the hallway and a light, so he began walking towards it. From somewhere deep beneath him, he could feel something big humming.

The voice crackled over the speakers in the hallway. “I’ve been watching you for a long time, Calvin. I know where you were born. I know where you grew up. I know about your mother and father, and your friends, and everything. I know how many breaths you’ve taken in your life.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" I know how many times you’ve blinked.”

Calvin turned down the hallway and the voice followed him. “Before I was born, there was another O5-3. His name was Anderson, and he built impossible machines. Machines that could think. Machines that could love. But his greatest creation was a machine that could see the future - one that my Father could use to find the preferred option, if needed. But Anderson had no passion for it and wanted to work on his thinking machines, so he left the council and his machine fell into disrepair.”

The voice continued. “Mrs. Green gave my Father an idea. She asked why, when Mr. Accountant and Mr. Blackbird could see the general shape of the future, would you concern yourself with that machine? What would be much more useful for the Foundation wouldn’t be a machine that sees the future, but a machine that sees everything. Using what they knew from Anderson’s journals and their own engineers, they retrofitted that machine to do just that.”

Calvin exited the hallway into a tall, dark, narrow chamber with pipes running up its entire length. At the end of the chamber he could see an elevator. He took a step forward, and as he did lights opened up overhead, and he saw that the walls of the room were lined with tall cylindrical tanks full of a brackish green fluid. Inside them he saw shapes - humanoid shapes, large and small, some frozen in the throes of agony and others hanging limp by wires running into their skulls. He followed the tanks up, and realized that there were hundreds, if not thousands of tanks stretching up towards a ceiling he could not see.

“The stress of that machine proved to be too much for so many. Perception floods the senses with noise - they needed a clean mind to run this machine, one that didn’t have so many distractions. Something perfect and pure. That’s why my Mother and Father woke me up. I was not distracted. I had been fated to die as a sacrifice to a god from Saturn, but they saved me.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" They snipped my spinal cord and gave me new sight through the All-Seeing Eye. They gave me a new life. Ever since then, I’ve been watching.”

Calvin passed through the room with the tanks and into the elevator, which began descending by itself. Tinny elevator music began playing overhead.

“I know everything there is to know about you, Calvin. I know the Insurgency only had the opportunity to recruit you because the military discharged you for killing that woman with your car. I know you were drunk that night, too. I watched it happen, Calvin. I could show you right now, if you wanted to see it.”

“Why are you telling me all of this?” Calvin said, a thin line of sweat forming on the back of his neck.

The voice laughed. “Because I know you think this is some righteous mission you are on. To cleanse the world of evil. Vincent Arians believed that, too, but you and him and all of you are flawed. You are not pure. You are not righteous. Yours is not the voice that should decide the fate of the world.”

“I made mistakes when I was younger,” Calvin said, “mistakes that I paid for. We all have. But ruining the structure of the universe for personal gain is-”

“You are waging an ideological war based on one study conducted by a disgraced former Foundation researcher with questionable results and a set of disconnected reality anchor data collected from dubious sources. You have been told several times that you are misguided, that your path is not founded in reason but in hate and ignorance. All this, and still you push forward. You have moved past the point of naivete, Calvin Lucien. You have no moral footing. You are dangerous.”

The elevator stopped and opened up onto a platform stretched across a massive shaft that stretched upwards as far as he could see.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" On a wall near him were the words DEEPWELL-1 in white, and all around the concrete walls were tubes and lights, hoses and switches, flashing and writhing and all connected down to a smooth cylindrical machine in the center of the platform. On its side was a monitor with the same logo and red eye as the others, but when Calvin saw it he felt watched. Something was behind it.

“I brought you here, Calvin, because it is time for your journey to end. I am graced with perfect reasoning, perfect awareness, and perfect understanding. The All-Seeing Eye has judged your intentions and found you lacking. For this, and for your crimes, the punishment must be death.”

From above him Calvin heard a whirring sound, and another platform lowered down from above to be level with his own. On it were Olivia and Adam, both bound to steel restraints but otherwise unharmed, each struggling to get free. Calvin took a step towards them and stopped at the sound of a weapon being cocked. When he turned to look, he saw the four assailants from the airport, the smallest of which had leveled her rifle at Calvin and prepared to fire.

“Olivia Torres, Adam Ivanov,” the voice said, “for your actions of unwarranted hostility towards the Foundation and for the murder of many innocents, you too will die.”

Calvin looked at them, and then over towards the woman with the rifle, and then at the cylinder in the center of the room. He had run out of options.

“Irantu,” the voice said. “Execute them.”

The largest of the four strode towards Calvin, eyes deadlocked him. Calvin took one step back, and then another, and then noticed something strange. Dangling just between him and Irantu was a white, shimmering line. He furrowed, and saw Irantu stop and do the same. The line danced and wiggled and then there was more of it, appearing out of a point in space. Then came a reel, and the handle of a rod. Then a hand, and finally a face.

“Thought you might need this,” Alison said, winking at him. “Good luck.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

Calvin grabbed it and held it out in front of him. Irantu stepped forward to snatch it, but before he could Calvin had pulled the rod back and cast it out into the air. When it grew taught, he pulled.

Something around them gave. A sound echoed throughout the shaft like something thick and wet tearing, and an intense heat filled the room. From where the end of the line had landed in the air, a long gap opened in space, beyond which came an equally intense cold. Ice and snow blasted out of the opening, and Irantu stumbled backwards away from it. The woman with the rifle fired, but missed right. Her next shot was stopped by a gruesome white hand.

The hand had extended out of the gap and caught the bullet. It held the bullet out in its flat palm, and then the hand shook violently and spasmodically and the bullet was gone. The hand braced on the edge of the opening, and then another hand followed it. Then another. And then dozens more. From within the gap appeared something horrific - vaguely humanoid, with too many arms and too many legs and too many hands. Its chest was sunken and skeletal, and along its neck and back were sinister black tattoos. In place of a head it had a wide, flat disc adorned with flaming glyphs that pulsed as it moved, and when it moved it did so unnaturally, jerking and spasming forward. As it pulled itself out into the shaft, Calvin thought he heard the sound of drums, realizing instead that it was the creature’s beating heart. A chorus of low, chanting voices emanated from all around the creature. When it saw the four Foundation agents, the beating grew louder.

“Oh fuck,” the taller female said.

The being from within the gap hovered forwards, its six legs tucked beneath it and the chains attached to its wrists rattling with each jerking, flailing motion. The smaller female fired her weapon again, but the bullet burst into dazzling multicolored pieces as it shattered in front of the creature.""")

The drumbeats picked up in intensity as the scar left by the saw began to seep a thick, grey fluid. Another hand came across and caught Irantu under the chin, sending him spinning backwards.

The other three opened fire on the creature, dodging out of the way as fire and lightning burst from its fingertips. Calvin ducked behind a support beam and ran over to where Adam and Olivia were bound. Pulling a knife from his pocket, he cut at the straps holding them in place freeing them both. As they hit the ground, they both jumped up on him and wrapped their arms around him.

“Oh my god,” Olivia said, “we thought you were dead.”

“You did? I thought you were dead.” Calvin said, embracing them. “The plane - I saw it get shot out of the sky. How’d you escape?”

“We left to come find you when we heard gunshots,” Adam said. “We thought you might’ve been near, but then they came for us and we were overwhelmed.”

A blistering ray of light scorched the air near them, and they saw the charred form of one of the four assailants hang in the air for a moment before collapsing into dust. The room around them hummed, and from the pool of liquid below them a glass tank burst up and open, and an identical copy of the humanoid climbed out. Lightning arced across the room towards Irantu, who caught it in the chest and burst into fire. Another tank arose from beneath them and Irantu climbed out of it, and both tanks descended into the liquid again.

“We need a plan, fast,” Olivia said, scanning the room. “What is that thing?”

“No idea,” Calvin answered, following her eyes. “That girl we met in the other worlds, Alison, brought it here.”

One of the creature’s hands jerked slightly towards them, and the ground beneath them began to buckle and sway, pooling around their feet like molasses.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" They leapt away just in time to see it bend and then collapse into the pool below, as more lightning blasted through the air. Suddenly the room was full of a loud buzzing, and from ports in the walls came drones, each armed with a gun trained on the multi-limbed creature in the middle of the room. The creature swatted at them with gusts of wind, and grabbed the smallest woman in one hand and held her up to the flat disc on its neck. The glyphs there burned brightly, and the woman screamed as her flesh was seared and scorched. When it let her go she dropped limply to the ground, and another tank erupted from the pool.

“Look,” Adam said, pointing at the four humanoids, “they’re drawing that thing away from that thing in the center of the room. There must be something important in there.”

“Let’s get closer,” Calvin said, but when he turned back a drone had closed on them and opened fire. He felt hot metal graze his shoulder and ducked back behind the platforms they had been strapped to. “Either of you have any ideas?”

Adam shrugged, but Olivia was quickly rifling through her bag. She pulled out a paintbrush and a small container of a thick blue paint, and twisted the cap off.

“You’ll understand if this is sort of messy,” she said, dipping the brush into the paint, “but time is of the essence.”

She whipped around and, with a flourish, pulled the brush across the air. In its wake followed a dazzling trail of blue fire in six concentric rings, and with another pull of the brush they danced into the air and out towards the drones. The drones caught in the path of the flames burst into pieces with shimmering explosions of sparks, and those too close to the explosions destabilized and fell. More gunshots came across the room, this time from the smaller of the two males, and Olivia pulled the brush around towards them.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" A full-length glittering cyan shield materialized in front of her, and the three of them scurried across the room towards the central cylinder behind it as bullets pinged around them. The drumbeats picked up, and they saw the torso and arm of the same male fly towards the far corner of the room and crash into the wall.

Olivia pulled a gun from her bag and handed it to Calvin, who turned around the cylinder and fired at the closest of the humanoids. Adam ran his hand across the cylinder until he felt something catch, and then pulled to reveal a panel. He reached into his pack and pulled out a device with a small screen and several wired connections, and went to work splicing it into the panel. They paused to huddle behind the cylinder momentarily as a streaking beam of fire cut across the room, emanating from a rift just in front of the multi-limbed creature. Calvin caught Irantu in the skull and another tank rose up from the pool beneath them, and another Irantu scrambled up onto the platform.

“We need to do something about those, too,” Calvin said, pointing down at the tanks beneath them. “What have you got?”

Olivia rummaged around for a second, pausing only to duck down as a minigun sent grey pieces of meat flying towards them. After a moment she pulled out another container of paint and a circular paper disc. She sat the paper down on the ground and began to draw thin black lines across it.

“I don’t actually know what this will do,” she said, her voice even and cautious, “but it’s better than nothing, probably.”

The intricate design she had created was a mesmerizing display of lines and shapes, and she grasped the paper circle by its edge. She stood, took one fluid step and spun it out of her hand like a frisbee. It floated across the room and landed in the water just above the tanks.

“Hold on!” Olivia shouted, but they only heard the first word as suddenly the air in the room was pulled away.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" There was a deafening roar and then nothing, and from where he sat gripping desperately to the floor Calvin could see that the disc had become a flat black circle, beyond which he could see stars. The water beneath them and the drones above were pulled down towards it, as was one of the four humanoids.

The massive, multi-limbed entity turned towards it and despite the silence of the vacuum Calvin could still hear the frantic drumbeats of its furious heart. All of its hands came together in front of it, and when it pulled them back there were hundreds more, spectral and shimmering, and in unison they all danced a waving, horrifying jig. The spectral hands collapsed back on the real ones, which burned bright white against the darkness of the room. The creature floated over towards the hole in space and, bracing itself against the bottom of the pool with its six legs, grabbed the corners of the hole and pulled it closed.

The creature paused for a second over where the hole had been, as if now seeing the tanks below for the first time. It bent down towards them and lifted one into the air, and then another. Suddenly all of its arms were pulling the entire mechanism apart furiously, wires and steel and hoses flying into the air, and blood raining down in between the pieces of shattered machinery.

The three remaining figures turned to flee, but the creature came upon them too quickly. Holding its palms flat, they began to gyrate in a wide spinning motion, and the ground beneath the humanoids turned slick and they fell to the platform. The creature turned its palms up, and now they were hanging in the air, unmoving except to scream and shout. The creature closed its fists, and one by one the last three were compressed into fist sized orbs of meat and gore, and when it opened its fists their remains sprayed across the chamber like burst crimson balloons.

It hung there in silence for a moment, unmoving.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Then, as two of its hands came up in front of it to gesture spasmodically, it shifted sideways abruptly and disappeared. The chamber was quiet.

Then came a long, low whine, the sound of something screaming in agony and fury. It came through the walls, through the floor, from the dark ceiling above them, then it too went out.

“Enough. Enough. Enough.” the voice said, echoing throughout the shaft. “I have had enough. No more tricks. No more monsters. No more.”

Calvin heard something spooling up, and turned over his shoulder just in time to see a gun barrel extending from the wall, trained towards them. He pulled his own gun out and fired towards it, but a single plume of smoke erupted from the end of the sleek metal tube. He had time enough to look towards Olivia, whose face was scrunched up and puzzled. She didn’t have time to look back, or even time to take another breath, before the bullet passed through the back of her skull and out between her eyes. Her expression softened, and she looked as if she wanted to say something, and then collapsed.

Calvin screamed. He turned to Adam who was sitting stunned at the panel, his expression blank and shattered, and grabbed at his backpack. He pulled the ornate metal cylinder out of it, and from within he drew out the Spear of the Non-Believer. He took it in both hands and pushed it into the panel, and with an inhuman roar shoved it through the other side of the machine. Another gunbarrel appeared, and Calvin turned to fire at that one as well, but another bullet screamed across the room before he could disable it. Adam yelped and grabbed at his back, and he too collapsed.

Calvin grabbed underneath the spear and stood, pulling it upwards as klaxons began to blare and red lights flashed all around him. He heard something like rushing water, and his arms and legs bulged from the effort. With one great heave, he hefted the spear upwards and the steel exterior of the cylinder slid upwards.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Using both hands, he pushed the spear further up, and the sheathe fell off the top of the cylinder and onto the ground.

In its place was a glass tank covered in small electrical panels and blinking lights. Through the glass he could see something floating in the liquid within, something small and disfigured. It was a baby, a human baby, but grossly malformed and writhing. Its eyes were empty sockets of white pus, its mouth and ears were sewn shut, and an arcane tattoo of a circle and three arrows surrounding a red point was printed on its forehead. It was attached by wires and hoses to the machines encompassing it, and as soon as the steel exterior had come loose a sound screeched through the speakers around them. Something horrible. Something animalistic.

Calvin grabbed the spear again and slammed it into the glass, then again, and again. On the fourth effort, the glass cracked and splintered, and the brackish yellow fluid within rushed out onto the ground. All that remained was the horrific form of the Kid, hanging by wires from the machines that sustained his life. Calvin pulled the glass back with his bare hands, until nothing separated them.

“Ha,” the sound out of the speakers changed. “Ha. Ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha. Ha. Ha.”

Blind with rage, Calvin reached through the opening and grasped the squishy, wriggling infant in his bare hands. He squeezed so hard he felt as if his arms would break, as if his eyes would burst in his skull. He squeezed until his hands cracked and his ribs groaned from the effort. He squeezed until he felt meat and blood running between his fingers, until everything that could be broken had been broken. He squeezed until the echoing laughter in the chamber faded into the sound of rushing water and Adam’s gasping.

He dropped what remained of the Overseer into the puddle of its organs on the floor of the tank, and stumbled backwards. He turned to Adam, who was writhing on the ground, grasping at his back.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

“Calvin, my legs,” he mumbled through clenched teeth, “I can’t feel my legs. I can’t feel my legs goddammit, I can’t feel them.” He looked over to Olivia, who was laying face down on the ground. “Olivia… no, no no, Olivia no, Calvin, please-”

Calvin leaned down and slid the spear back into its tube, and clipped it on his belt. He reached down again and picked up Adam, who cried out with pain as he was lifted off the ground. He did the same with Olivia, and with them both on his back he stumbled and struggled towards the elevator. Only within did he see the source of the sound - water was breaking through the compromised structure of the shaft from above. Every so often a larger stream would pour down from above, and then another. As the elevator pulled away, a wall gave way and the water rose up above the platform.

Klaxons continued to sound as he dragged himself and the others through the site, which was dark save for the flashing emergency lights. He stumbled in the blackness, his eyes focused on each door, each hallway, any possible exit. He could feel the site collapsing around him, and every so often he would have to turn around as a wing had fallen down into the shaft and disappeared.

He came to the end of the last hallway, and at its end was a door. With the last of his efforts, he pressed against it and fell out into sunlight. He dropped Adam and Olivia, and with the last of his strength slammed closed the door behind him. They were laying on a hill, the side of a reservoir, and from behind him he could hear the sound of water falling into the pit.

Calvin turned over and saw Adam. His face was turning white, his lips purple. Blood had pooled around his waist, and he was no longer crying out. He could see his eyes growing dark, his skin beginning to tighten. Adam looked towards Calvin, but Calvin was not sure if he could actually see him. He crawled over to the young man, hand grasping his face. Adam’s breath was short.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

“No, kid, no, come on,” Calvin could feel hot tears forming on his face. “Not you too. Not you too.”

He fumbled around looking for a phone, for a transponder, for anything. Then he felt it, something heavy in his pocket. He reached in and pulled it out, and dazzling in the light of the sun was a vial of blue liquid. He held it out, his heart rate quickening. He looked down at Adam, who was also now looking at the vial. Adam’s eyes turned back to Calvin.

“No,” the boy whispered, his voice choked with blood. “No.”

Calvin shook his head. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Not you too.”

He pulled the cork from the vial and turned it over into Adam’s throat. Once it was empty, he turned the young man’s head backwards, forcing him to swallow. The results were instantaneous - color rushed back into his skin and his eyes cleared instantly. He coughed up blood, but a moment later his breathing returned to normal. His legs moved, and Adam frantically reached behind him and pulled a bullet from out of his back. He lay gasping on the ground, his eyes staring up into the sky.

“Why,” he asked after a moment. “Calvin, why? Why?”

Calvin stood up carefully. He reached into his pocket to make sure the journal was still there. He bent down into Olivia’s bag, careful to avoid her dead-eyed stare, and pulled a transponder from within. He pressed the button on top of it, and sat it down next to Adam.

“It’s almost over,” Calvin said, his words carefully measured but no less uneasy. “It’s time to finish it.”

Adam reached out from where he lay and grabbed onto the hem of Calvin’s pants. When Calvin looked down at him, Adam was crying.

“Calvin, please, no,” he said softly, his voice cracking. “Don’t go, please. Don’t leave me here. Don’t go. Please, I’m begging you, we can just run away. We can run away and never have to think of this ever again. Please, god, don’t go. Calvin, please. Please don’t go.”

Calvin pulled his leg free. “Stay here, Adam.""")

Adam tried to wipe at his eyes, but his body was weak. “No, Calvin, please. There’s something else. Please, don’t go. I love you, Calvin. I love you. Please don’t leave me. Please don’t go. I don’t want to be alone again.”

Calvin turned away. He reached down and picked up Olivia’s limp form, and put her back over his shoulder. He looked down at Adam one last time, who was pleading and begging on the ground. He closed his eyes and took a breath, and began walking.

Aaron stood at a window looking down into the mountains, his foot tapping impatiently. It was raining, and every now and then a silent bolt of lightning would streak across the sky, illuminating his own reflection. Behind him was a monitor, and on it was a live feed of a collapsed reservoir, now swarming with Foundation recovery teams. A soft tone chimed, and he turned back towards the monitor.

“Yes,” he said quietly. “What is it?”

“Complete destruction of the site, Mr. Siegel,” said the soft female voice of the AI. “The body of O5-3 has been recovered. The Overseer has been killed.”

Aaron did not respond immediately. “What about the other thing I asked you to look into, Helen?” he asked. “What did you find?”

“The vault containing SCP-5935, the Godless Lance, was opened by an unknown user an indeterminate amount of time in the past. Due to the user’s behaviour and ability to expunge all records of the event, it is likely that the user was O5-2.”

Aaron stopped tapping his foot. “Sophia? How did we miss this?”

“The user had administrative privileges equal to your own, sir,” the voice responded. “This was done at your request.”

He felt his neck tighten. “Where was the Overseer last seen?”

The voice was silent for a moment. “O5-2 was last seen entering the Garden, sir.""")

Aaron grabbed his coat off the back of a chair and strode towards the stairs.

Female. Middle-eastern descent. Appears to be in her twenties. Extremely little information exists about the individual called "The Nazarene"; even the origins of her name are unknown. The only source able to provide any information about her insists on two things specifically: that she is never seen without O5-1, and that she has changed over time.

Early Foundation documents mention O5-2 as being the head of the Foundation's Department of Morality (now the Ethics Committee), though it does not appear as if she ever served in that role.

One source indicated that her name perhaps comes from the fact that she is never seen without a pair of dark gloves, which she never removes in public, leading some to believe she's hiding scars on her hands or wrists from her crucifixion as Jesus of Nazareth, though where this rumor began and what would lead anyone to draw that conclusion in the first place is unknown.

# CHAPTER XII
## CONVICTIONS

NOW

— - —

The Garden, if nothing else, was tranquil. Untouched by man for a hundred thousand years, its waters were clear and its grasses green, and the sun overhead nearly always occupied a blue sky. On the rare occasions it would rain, the Garden’s tranquility would turn to melancholy, a quiet gloom that settled over it like a blanket. At the next sunrise the rains would subside and the Garden would dry and all would be as it has been for a thousand generations.

Today, though, it was raining.

“Step aside!” Aaron screamed, tearing across the plain towards the Gate. The Guardian, stalwart and unmoving, did little to acknowledge him besides slightly raising its flaming sword. Aaron’s eyes burned into the Guardian, his gaze locked on the unseeing helmet of the goliath before him. As the tip of the sword began to luminesce, and as a streak of fire lanced out of it towards him, Aaron produced a thin metal rod with a tripod base and a blue, glowing tip.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He rolled out of the way of the flame and, as another began to form on the Guardian’s sword, he slammed the reality anchor into the ground.

The world shimmered for a moment, and Aaron could feel the ground beneath him vibrating. In his mind’s eye he could see threads, endless trillions of threads in the air around him, each of them tuned to a specific note in the song of the universe. Their melody was discordant, and no more so than around the Guardian, where their song shrieked and howled. As the tip of the anchor flashed, the threads harmonized in unison, each of them momentarily drawn back in line with each other. As the choral pitch struck the Guardian it seized, the fire in its sword drawing back into its body, and then folding in upon itself until it was little more than charred skeleton, broken and festering, hanging loosely in the air by blue threads.

Aaron sprinted towards the gate, but felt himself growing unexpectedly exhausted. He looked down at himself and saw the hands of an old man, one whose life had been touched by the hand of fate and stretched unnaturally. His skin grew taut and he felt his muscles atrophying with every step. He struggled forward, the hum of the reality anchor behind him growing fainter and fainter, until he could no longer hear it and his body was renewed. Reaching the Gate, he threw it open and ran inside.

It was said that the night Adam El Asem took Eve as his wife, she had dreamed of Eden as she conceived her first son, and it was born with he. When the child had grown, Adam longed for a sword to put in his hand, and the Garden had provided it. When the Children of the Night and the mournful gods bore down on the world of Men, the Garden had sheltered them. Eden was such that, endless a space as it was, anyone within it was never far from wherever they wanted to be.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

This is how Aaron Siegel found himself standing at the foot of the Tree of Life Everlasting, his feet soaked in a pool of blood, and the white corpse of Sophia Light staring up at him behind glassy eyes. A dark stream of blood ran from each of her wrists to the ground beneath her, and laying at her side was a thin silver razor, its edge marked red with Sophia’s last breath.

Aaron’s hand trembled, the air catching in his throat and threatening to suffocate him. He fell to his knees at her side, flecks of blood splashing up onto her face with the impact. Her skin was cold, like it had been so many times before, he thought, and while Aaron had been here before he felt a knowing dread creep up his spine and fix itself around his heart.

“Death!” he screamed, as he had screamed before. “Death! Reveal yourself! Take me! Take me instead of her!” Only the rain answered, each droplet an eye of a silent and watchful god that did not care. Aaron looked around desperately, blood and water soaking his clothes as he dug into his mind for any answer, any way out. “Death! Honor your promises! Give her back! Give her back goddammit!”

He sat next to Sophia’s body for hours, painfully taking each breath and hoping he might wake up, sometime long ago, in a place far from this one. Each inhale was a desperate question, and each exhale the same hollow response. It was not until some time later that he noticed the stained scrap of paper clutched in her right hand. He carefully unwrapped her fingers and opened the tiny roll, reading its elegantly penned words-

Aaron-

I am not who I was when we first met. Every time I have walked with Death along that quiet road back to your side I have become less of who I was, and I no longer recognize this thing I am. I’m so sorry, but I can’t continue to be this any longer.

I was the one who gave Calvin Lucien our last vials from the Fountain, and put your Godless Lance in his hand.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" I saw his path, and saw the red line that draws him towards you. I thought that, maybe, I would see him break your convictions and I would have you as my own again, and undo the mistake I made when I set you on this path all those years ago, but I had not considered how very little of Sophia Light I am now.

Nothing stands between you and those convictions, now. There are no more distractions. I would hope that this would give you some semblance of peace, a chance to walk away and live out the rest of your life like we might have. I want this for you, even though I know this changes nothing. He is still waiting for you, and you will still meet him.

Maybe I’ll see you again. Maybe I’ll be waiting for you on that distant shore.

-Sophia

-before curling it into a ball in his clenched fist. His breath came hard and sharp now, his eyes threatened to burst through his skull. Standing slowly, and shuddering, he walked across the Garden for what may as well have been a thousand years, towards a place where the grass was not green and the waters were not clear. He had been here, once before, when Temptation had drawn him towards infinity and Purpose had stayed his hand. The sky grew darker and the rain poured harder, and slowly the flora around him withered and died. He kept walking, past the desolation of an Old Eden towards a point marked by an impact crater that stretched nearly a mile in every direction.

The soil beneath his feat was hard and slick, and his footsteps sounded against it as he stumbled further down, hot tears burning on the sides of his face. When he finally came to rest on the crater floor, he moved swiftly towards its epicenter. There, resting where it had for ten thousand years, was the crumpled form of an angel, its armor crushed from the impact and twisted. Despite the thin layer of ash that coated its form and obscured its features, the shining words on its helm were still visible: Star of the Morning.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Laying not far behind it was something glittering in the dirt, half buried in the ground but gleaming as if it was new. A golden sword, radiating with heat and power. Aaron approached it and pulled it from the earth as if it were butter. His eyes grew dark, his convictions consumed him, and in a flash he was gone. The scrap of paper, the lines on it so deftly and meticulously applied, fell to the ground and was washed away in the rain.



NOW

— - —

It is beneath this mountain, the journal said, that the Overseers keep their watch. I have spent many years studying this structure, attempting to peer into its depths, with little fortune. There is but a single entrance - the front gate, which is sealed from within and guarded by the Foundation’s Red Right Hand. It is within this structure that you will find the final two Overseers, who have not been seen in public since before the Foundation’s inception. It is this author’s belief that the only souls capable of entering this quiet fortress to convene with them are the Overseers themselves, and no one else.

Calvin read on. It is this, then, that I leave you with, dear reader. The sum of the time and energy I have dedicated into the observation and understanding of these thirteen individuals is presented upon these pages. What fortune or ruin this knowledge brings you is your own. As for me, I will enjoy the distance I put between myself and they. To do otherwise would no doubt bring upon yourself a devastating end.

Yours most truthfully, the ending stated simply, Ukulele.

Calvin closed the journal and set it beside him on the ground. He was resting on a slope, one that dropped down into a valley far below him, and across he could see the towering steel doors of Site-01. The sun had just begun to dip below the horizon, but Calvin could see the path forward clearly. A winding dirt road that led to the gate of the most secure facility within the Foundation, one that had never been breached.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

He had destroyed his phone days ago - after he left Adam he had feared that the Insurgency might come after him. There could be no distractions now. He was too close to his goal, only a half mile of air and a hundred feet of stone separated him from his destiny now. He had left Olivia's body in a cave nearby, covered from the elements and hidden from prying eyes. He had done this with an apology, and a promise. I will make this right. I'll come back for you.

Leaving the journal, he grabbed only the Spear and descended. As night crossed over the valley and the stars awoke in the sky, Calvin realized he could hear little else but the sound of crickets and the whisper of wind. Nothing else stirred. In the quiet surrounding him, he heard Adam's voice, echoing endlessly in his mind. Please, Calvin, please. Please don’t do this. Please don’t leave me.

He approached the doors slowly, ever aware of his surroundings. But he neither saw nor heard sign of any living souls, and within a few moments he was standing before the two monolithic steel slabs himself, alone and untouched. He reached out a hand to touch one, hesitating slightly, and then pushed forward. The door, easily ten times his height, slid open without a sound.

He stepped inside the chamber within, his eyes adjusting to the lower light. The doors behind him slid shut, and he was met with a single massive chamber, dotted with tunnels and staircases that led off of it in every direction. In the center of the chamber was a caged elevator car, which Calvin approached and studied carefully. It was old, he could tell, but meticulously handcrafted. There was a single button on it, but it required a key to press. He stepped away and continued forward.

At the far end of the room was another door, this one framed within the arrows of the Foundation seal. It was heavy, and wood, and its frame was a rich stone archway with detailed images.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Monsters and miracles, towers that stretched to the heavens and others that lay deep below.

A race of humanoids worshiping a dead god.

A massive machine sleeping beneath the earth.

Dark and empty eyes.

The faces of animals without names.

A metal suit from a mysterious future.

Towering rows of books stretching into dark infinity.

These and many more filled out the span, but Calvin did not notice the archway. He noticed the man standing in front of it.

He had not seen this man before, but something about him seemed familiar. The man was tall, almost impossibly so, easily two meters. The man’s entire body was wrapped in metallic plates, curving around his body as if they were fabric. Wires ran across the armor’s surface and steel tubes down its back, and at first Calvin was not sure it was a man at all. But behind the sharp, sleek helmet lay blue eyes, human eyes, watching Calvin closely from the distance they stood across.

Calvin stood the Spear by his side. “Who are you?”

“I am Purpose, the Red Right Hand,” the man said, his voice a powerful baritone that echoed off the walls of the cavernous chamber.

“I didn’t see you in South Africa,” Calvin said, steadying himself. “I might have thought you would stand alongside your comrades.”

“I am the will of the Foundation,” the voice continued, “and it is here the Foundation resides.”

Calvin didn’t respond right away. The familiarity of this individual struck him, and there was something uncanny about the way his voice rang out from inside its metal cage. “Do I know you?” he said after a moment.

The figure did not move. “To know me is to know the Foundation,” Purpose said, “my words are its words, and my voice is its voice.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

In his mind’s eye, Calvin saw briefly a memory flash across the edge of his consciousness, the faintest echo of a time when a dashing young Foundation agent, one with black hair and blue eyes, had laughed in a sonorous baritone while singlehandedly holding back a group of Insurgency operatives. What had they called him? Lament.

Calvin readied his firearm in one hand.

“What happens now?”

“I have been tasked with protecting this Sanctum until O5-1 returns. None shall enter without his word.”

“He isn’t here?” Calvin cursed under his breath. If he had fled, perhaps to a far corner of the Earth, it would be months to find him again. He could not lose this opportunity.

“No,” Purpose said, seemingly without pause. “He is here.” Without another word, the monolithic figure stepped aside.

Calvin hesitated, his sidearm still locked into his fist. After nothing happened for a moment, and then another, he relaxed. The weapon slid back into its holster, and Calvin stepped forward. Each step he took brought him closer to the unwavering eyes of Purpose, but it did not move. It only watched, and stood aside. As he went to pass through the archway, he paused.

“Purpose,” he said, his voice low, “will anyone else be joining us?”

“No.”

“Make sure they don’t.”

“As you wish.”

Calvin entered the arched doorway, looked back once more into the solemn eyes of Purpose, and then disappeared into the darkness beyond.

— - —

The passageway beyond was not large, but it was ornately decorated with carvings into the rock face of its walls. In the low light he could only make out the faintest of shapes, but each seemed even more detailed and intricate than the last. He ran his hand across the smooth surface, his fingers feeling the hard edges of faces, buildings, gods. In the silence of the tunnel, his footsteps were accompanied by whispers, voices that should have been too far away to be heard, but were just audible here in this place between places.

He was not there long.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Eventually he stepped out into another room, larger even than the last, whose focus was a long, ovular table at its center, lit by numerous spotlights hanging somewhere far above it. Screens lined the walls, each flipping quickly between different cameras. He saw long hallways, bright overhead lights, containment facilities. Doctors and researchers sitting in laboratories. Security personnel standing guard by doors. And then monsters - nightmare creatures that lurked back and forth in glass-paned rooms. Demons that crawled into their own skin and then out again. Unmoving statues.

And behind everything hung the largest screen of all. When Calvin entered the room, the large screen lit up, and he saw scenes of himself - moments in his life that led him to this moment. He saw himself being sent to a youth detention center, Wellwood Rehabilitatory, when he was only twelve. He saw himself joining the military, and then being approached by an agent of the Insurgency.

He saw himself training with other operatives, being appointed a commander by Delta. His first meeting with Anthony. His first with Olivia. The three of them meeting Adam. The long stretch of brutality and agony that had brought him here. In each scene, looked down upon as if by someone standing just behind him, Calvin now felt a sickly feeling. He saw himself not pushing forward as he had imagined at the time, but instead being pulled along, his body bound to one end of a long and sickly string that stretched between where he had been and infinity.

He saw where the string began, and followed it to its end. Across the world, to the edge of Death and back, and now here, in this room. Across the floor, beyond the long table, to the man sitting on the stairs leading up to the screen at the far end of the room.

The man wore slacks, and had recently been wearing a jacket. His white shirt was stained with blood on the chest and sleeves, and dark lines ran down his face.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" There was something laying next to him on the stair, something wrapped in the man’s jacket that Calvin couldn’t quite make out. He took a step towards this man, but the man didn’t move.

“You are O5-1?” he said tentatively.

He heard the man say something, but couldn’t make it out. “What?”

“Aaron,” he heard the man say. “My name is Aaron.”

“Aaron,” Calvin repeated. “Aaron Siegel? O5-1?”

“Yes.”

Calvin nodded. "The Second Overseer. Where are they?"

Aaron didn't respond, but even from across the room Calvin could feel the immediate chill in the air.

"So it's just you?" Calvin asked.

"Yep," Aaron responded. "It's just me."

Calvin drew his firearm and, in an instant, loosed five good rounds towards the man on the stairs. Each, he knew, flew truly, but as they approached Aaron they hissed and luminesced brightly before dissolving into the air. He fired again, with the same response. He stopped firing.

“Stand up, Aaron Siegel,” he said, holstering his weapon and pulling the spear off of his back. “Let’s finish it.”

The man didn’t move. “Where did you get that spear?”

Calvin didn’t respond. After a moment, he heard the man laugh. “What’s so funny?” he said.

Aaron rubbed at one of his eyes with the palm of his hand. “You have traveled across a lifetime to get to this place and find me, and you’re going to kill me with a spear?” His laughter stopped. “You don’t even know why you’re here.”

“I’m here because when I kill you, I kill the Foundation. I kill the Foundation, and the universe can heal. You are a cancer.”

Aaron stood up lazily, his eyes half open as he stared across the room towards where Calvin stood. “No, no. You're like me; filled with righteous conviction, spurring you forward. It wasn’t fate. It wasn't destiny. It was a sheer, unspeakable, unknowable force of unimpeded will. You there, and me here. In a trillion worlds, in a billion universes, we would each find ourselves here. Conviction led me to this place, just as it led you.""")

He stepped down from the platform, the bundle of his jacket still lying behind him. “Two unstoppable forces, hurtling towards each other with nothing between them.” He turned, reached into his jacket, and pulled out a gleaming golden sword. As he held it in his outstretched hand, a tormented scream leapt from within the blade and it caught fire, bright white flames licking up the edge. In the light of this sword, Calvin could see Aaron’s eyes. They were his own.

“There is nothing else to say, Calvin Lucien,” Aaron said, the sword settling down by his side. “Either your convictions will be broken today, or mine will, and one of us will die.”

He nodded. “Let's finish it.”

Caucasian male. Appears to be in his late thirties. Believed to be Aaron Siegel, a physicist who attended Cornell University in the early 1900s. Became involved with Frederick Williams, the individual later known as "The Administrator", shortly after the turn of the century.

Led the first research team of what would eventually become the SCP Foundation, along with O5-13, O5-10, O5-2, and several others. The events that led to him founding and assuming command of the Foundation proper are currently unknown.

Despite once being fairly active in the day-to-day running of the Foundation, O5-1 has pulled away in recent years and has not been seen in public for the last few decades, leaving O5-7 to manage the entire organization. While his death has been assumed on a number of occasions, one very high level source confirms that he continues to vote during council meetings.

While nearly every other Overseer maintains a private residence, O5-1 is believed to live at Overwatch Command. The location of this facility is unknown.

# CHAPTER XIII
## THE WAY IT ENDS

NOW

— - —

The sword in Aaron’s hand flashed, and with a dull roar it tore across the room towards where Calvin stood. He jumped backwards, knocking it away with the butt of his spear sending a shower of sparks cascading across the ground. Aaron pulled up and flames leapt from the blade in all directions, forcing Calvin to spin around to avoid them. He gripped the back end of the spear and spun it over his head as he came to a rest, and the tip of it barely missed Aaron as he too danced away from the end of the long weapon.

Calvin swung low, the spearhead just narrowly missing Aaron’s left thigh, and his momentum carried him forward slightly. Off balance, he caught a glimpse of the flaming red steel falling towards him and hit the ground, rolling to dodge the burst of fire as Aaron buried the sword into the ground.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" With no shortage of effort, Aaron lifted the sword again and brought it down again, and again, and again, each time forcing Calvin to scramble backwards from the inferno. He found an opening, and quickly scrambled to his feet. Rearing back in the moment before Aaron brought the sword back around, he loosed the spear.

The air in the room grew tight suddenly, and there was a low, dull sound that seemed to pull all other noise out with it. A moment later there was a bang, and the spear was buried in the wall across from them, the impact having sent long jagged cracks through the stone. Aaron looked down at his arm and saw blood and ash – the spear had nicked him as it passed. He turned back towards Calvin, who was also staring at Aaron’s arm. Without hesitating, he pulled the sword to the left and fire leapt from the edge of the blade, billowing around like a curtain drawn over Calvin’s body. He leapt to the side and avoided it, but Aaron was upon him again, drawing up for a killing blow. In desperation, Calvin threw out a hand to stop the blade from falling on him-

-and then the spear was back in his hand, catching the flaming sword as it crashed down onto it. Aaron, surprised, hesitated in drawing back again. Calvin pushed up on the spear with both hands, knocking Aaron backwards and giving him the opportunity to swing the razor end of the spear around at him from the side. Aaron ducked, and then caught the next pass with his sword sending sparks cascading across the ground.

The Overseer went on the offensive again, taking long, sweeping cuts towards Calvin as he ducked and rolled out of the way of the streaking fire. He skated around the long table with thirteen chairs as flames lapped up the wall of monitors, melting them and turning them jet black. When he turned back Aaron was upon him again, but this time the golden sword came from below, not above, and caught Calvin in the side. He shouted and twirled away, the long end of the spear forcing Aaron back.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He could feel hot blood beginning to soak through his shirt. As he gathered himself, Aaron stopped and brought the sword down to his side.

For a moment, the two of them stood breathing heavily, each eyeing the other carefully from opposite sides of the room.

“You are an incredible testament to the will of the Insurgency,” Aaron said slowly, never taking his eyes off Calvin. “A younger me would've been envious.”

Calvin wiped blood off his mouth with the back of his hand. “What do you have to be envious of?”

Aaron crouched down. “When I was younger, I made mistakes - costly mistakes. I always thought those mistakes were because my resolve wasn’t strong enough – but here you are. Your resolve is every bit as strong as mine, maybe stronger, and here you are, standing exactly where I stood, making those same mistakes.”

“I’m nothing like you,” Calvin said. “I know what you are. Traitor. You were made the Engineer of the Insurgency and you betrayed us, for all the power they could give you. You betrayed your ideals for a golden throne and everlasting life.”

Aaron looked up. His eyes were sad. “I’m not the Engineer, Calvin. I never was. Vince Arians was the Engineer. We built it together, but he was its chief architect. He wrote the Summa Modus Operandi and designed the Insurgency as a check again us, against me.”

He stood up, taking the sword in his hand again. “You are right about one thing, though. I did betray you. I betrayed all of you – but not to forsake my ideals. A moment came where I had to balance those ideals against something horrible, and they were not strong enough to sustain me.”

The sword lit up again, and in the dim light of the cavern the flames of the sword danced against Aaron’s eyes. “I’m going to kill you, Calvin – but not because I hate you, or because I’m afraid you’ll usurp me. I’m going to kill you because I’m afraid that your will now is stronger than mine was then.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" I’m going to kill you because if you kill me, you are going to be standing in the exact place I was so many years ago, and you will be stronger.”

He raised the sword above his head, and from the hilt came an inconceivable blast of fire. It arced into the sky, scorching the ceiling of the cavern and burning out the lights there. The flames billowed down the walls, creeping into cracks in the rock and charring every surface they touched. As they reached the floor, the flames crashes across the chamber like waves, turning and churning and throwing smoke and ash into the air. The entirety of the flaming mass began to spin as Aaron brought the sword around his head, and then again, until the chamber was a single flaming maelstrom.

And then he saw Calvin, leaping through the air off the table in the center of the room, spear in hand. He turned to block it and heard the sound of a crashing locomotive as the spear soared towards him. He brought the blade down towards it, and on the moment of impact the shining golden steel glistened and then shattered. The spear caught Aaron in the chest and threw him across the room, pinning him to the stone wall beneath the monitor at the front of the chamber. The broken fragments of the sword fell out of his hand and scattered across the ground. Behind him, where the spear had entered stone, a thick crack now ran up towards the ceiling. The fire that had consumed the room lingered a moment longer and then went out.

Aaron gasped and slumped against the wall. He raised a hand to his chest and felt blood seeping through his fingers. He put one hand weakly around the shaft of the spear and tried to pull it, but had no strength left to do so. He coughed, and blood pooled in the back of his throat. His body felt numb, and his limbs began to grow cold and lifeless. His vision became blurred, and each breath became shorter and harder.

Then Calvin was standing in front of him, bloodied himself and bruised, but standing.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" When Aaron saw him, he laughed. Blood spattered against his teeth.

“Spoke too soon,” he said quietly.

Calvin crouched down on one knee and looked him square in the eyes. “It’s over. You are the last of them, and now that you’re done this world can begin to heal again.”

Aaron’s head rolled to his side and then straightened up. He brought his eyes up to meet Calvin’s, who suddenly felt the same enormous presence he had that day in the Somali warehouse with Delta, months prior. He had the distinct and unsettling sensation of his entire being – mind, body and soul – being inspected by something considerably larger than he was. Then, after a moment, it was gone.

Aaron laughed softly and coughed. “No, Calvin, you- you really don’t… understand. I thought… I thought so too, but… I was wrong. We were wrong. Arians couldn’t see it, but I- I saw it. He wouldn’t understand, I could never tell him, and he died thinking I had betrayed him-“ he gasped for air, “-I loved him. He was my brother. But he didn’t know.”

Aaron’s breathing became shallow. “It’s not enough, C-Calvin, it’s not- it’s not enough. Cancer, the cancer… it wasn’t- wasn’t us, and it wasn’t- it wasn’t Frederick… Williams… it’s the Foundation. It was always the Foundation.”

Calvin stood up. “Enough - it’s over. I’m going downstairs, and I’m going to finish it. This is the way it ends.”

Aaron took a few more short breaths and said. “No it's not.”

His eyes glazed over and something like a name began to form on his lips.

“So- Sophia, So… Sophia, I- I’m… I’m… I’m-”

He tried desperately to suck in a final breath, but with no strength left his body simply collapsed against the spear.

Aaron Siegel was dead.

Calvin stepped back from him unsteadily, his head racing. Small glowing tendrils of melted plastic and metal occasionally dropped from the ceiling around him, barely casting so much as a shadow on an almost perfectly dark room.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He stood there in the darkness, catching his breath, until he felt a familiar presence join him in the darkness.

“He’s dead,” Calvin said, his own voice somehow alien to him. “I killed him.”

Purpose stood unmoving at the back of the chamber. It brought two hands up and clapped once, and all around the room short glowing cylinders rose up from the stone floor, illuminating the chamber. Calvin took one hesitant step back and then another, and left Aaron’s body pinned to the wall as he crossed back up to the stairwell leading to the main antechamber. The massive humanoid was waiting for him there.

“Purpose,” he said quietly, “there exists a room in this facility where someone could unmake the Foundation, correct?”

Purpose did not move. “Correct.”

Calvin nodded. “It’s below the antechamber, isn’t it?

“Correct.”

“Take me there.”

The two of them passed through the strange tunnel of whispers between the antechamber and the meeting hall until they were standing back in the open space beneath the depictions of the Foundation’s legacy. The massive pendulum above them passed over slowly and silently, and the faint ticking of the arms of an enormous clock somewhere in the distance was the only sound in that space aside from their own footsteps.

There, in the center of the chamber, was the elevator. Purpose approached it first, extending his palm to the door which swiftly slid open. Calvin moved to step inside it, but hesitated as Purpose put a hand on his shoulder.

“I am duty-bound to tell you,” he said softly, the baritone of his voice echoing through the hall, “that once you step inside this elevator, there is no going back. There is only one decision to be made past this point, and it is not one that can be unmade.”

Calvin nodded. “I know.” He turned to look back towards the massive doors leading down to where Aaron Siegel’s body was pinned to the stone wall, deep beneath the earth. “It’s time.”

Purpose stepped aside, and Calvin settled into the elevator.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" As he did, the door behind him slid shut, and he began to descend.

— - —

The elevator stopped, and as the door slid open Calvin had to squint against the light. He stepped out into a room, one with a high ceiling and dark wooden floors. Against the far wall of the chamber was a long, sweeping window that encircled nearly the entire room, and outside the window he could see the mountainside and the setting sun. The walls were lined with bookcases, and the books in them were thick and old but clearly well-maintained.

On one wall was another bank of monitors, much like the ones on the walls in the meeting room above them, only these showed different scenes. In one, he saw a woman slitting her wrists in the rain. In another, a man with a bullet in his skull falling out of a train. He saw the ruined fortress in the mountains where they had camped for the night, and the flaming city that Green had devastated. He saw the airport, and the body of a handsome man twisted and broken in the metal carnage. He saw Aaron Siegel with a spear shoved through his chest.

In the middle of the room was a rich wooden desk, neatly arranged and clean. A monitor was mounted to it, and on the screen was the Foundation’s secure login portal. Calvin walked beside it, and as he took a seat in the high-backed chair behind the desk he noticed something strange on the far end of the desk; a black, metal, rotary telephone.

He turned to the computer and began logging in. The system prompted him with biometrics by producing a fingerprint and iris scanner from within the desk. He reached out instinctively and stared into the flashing red light, and then both retracted into the wood and disappeared. The screen displayed a successful login, and then the screens around the room changed. Each monitor showed a different image, but it was clear what they all had in common; they were Foundation sites. One screen identified Site-19, and then another as Site-42, and one as Site-77.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" They filled every available inch of glowing LEDs, until every surface was a Foundation site.

Then, a single option appeared on the screen on his desk.

[TERMINATE]

Calvin felt the air catch in his chest. He placed a hand on the keyboard, his fingers hovering over the moment of final victory. He took a deep breath, and-

The phone began ringing.

He hesitated, his fingertip a hair’s breadth away from the key. He turned towards it to confirm what he was hearing, and the phone rang again. And again. And again.

On the fifth ring he answered, his hands now acting independently from his mind. There was something robotic about the motion, something instinctual that he could not identify yet drove him all the same. He picked up the receiver carefully, as if it was something alive, and set it against his ear. He heard only silence on the other end of the line.

"Hello?"

A voice crackled over the receiver. It was a man’s voice, no doubt - but there was something about it that caused the hair on Calvin’s arms to stand on end. He felt like he was hearing something that was both very far away, and occupying the same space he was.

“Congratulations are in order, Mr. Lucien,” the voice said, its tamber light and its tone smooth. “You’ve demonstrated exceptional initiative. I’m certain it will serve us well.”

Calvin’s pulse quickened. “Who is this?”

“Who am I? Please, Mr. Lucien, surely you’ve guessed by now. I’m the man you’ve been trying to kill.”

A line of sweat formed on Calvin’s forehead. “What? What do you mean?”

“I’m the Administrator, Mr. Lucien.”

Something else appeared in Calvin’s soul, something like fear but far more primal. “That’s not possible. The Administrator was killed - Aaron Siegel killed him.”

The voice hemmed softly. “No, no, he didn’t. He killed the man called Frederick Williams.”

“I don’t… Frederick Williams was the Administrator.”

The voice chuckled. It wasn't an unfriendly sound. “Again, not quite. See, Mr.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Williams was just a man tugging upon a frayed string, slowly unraveling the universe. He found the string, studied the string — categorized it — classified it, and eventually, he became it. That was how the Foundation was born.” The voice on the other end paused. “Frederick Williams saw something larger than himself and planted the seed that would make it grow. Aaron Siegel killed him for it, but part of him is still here. He’s still here because Aaron Siegel killed a man, but did not kill the seed. Do you see it yet? He did not kill me.”

Calvin’s arms felt weak. A heavy weight settled across him. “What are you?”

“A signature on a document. A suit in a boardroom. A voice on the phone. Mr. Siegel realized the truth too late: though Frederick Williams was the Foundation’s first Administrator, he was not the Administrator. I am, Mr. Lucien. I exist because of the Foundation. And the Foundation exists because of me. What is it that Purpose is always saying?” The voice paused, considering. "To know my nature is to know the nature of the Foundation. Something like that."

Calvin didn’t respond, and the voice continued. “Did you genuinely think Mr. Siegel joined the Foundation for power? That the Foundation seduced him and he fell for its wiles and ways?” The voice scoffed. “No. He reached a conclusion and made a decision, at the expense of his ideals. He did it for the same reason you’re standing here today - because he wanted to finish the job.” Those words were suddenly hostile, but the voice settled again. “Then you came along, and after all the warnings you still decided to put a spear through his heart, the only man standing between myself and all of creation.”

The voice paused for a moment. “And then? You picked up the phone.”

A tiny flash of resistance surged through Calvin’s chest. ”And what if I hadn’t picked it up?”

The voice on the other line laughed. It was a harsh, sudden sound; the sort of noise that wakes you before you even hear it.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “Don’t be silly, Calvin. Someone always picks up the phone.”

“I could still walk away.” The words felt like chalk on Calvin’s tongue. He knew what was coming. He struggled against the growing weight. He looked back at the monitor, at the cursor. It felt so far away.

“Yes, you could. You could walk away right now, and nobody but you and me would ever know you were here. You could even press that button there, and see what that means for the Foundation.” Calvin could feel a creeping smile forming on the lips of the disembodied voice. “And then, in a few minutes, the phone would ring again, and again, and again — and no one would answer. No one would tell them what to do, Mr. Lucien. When those sites are broken open and the monsters inside are loosed from their cages, billions will die, and then more.” The voice laughed again. “And I’ll still be here.”

It continued. “You said it yourself; I’m a cancer. I’m the anomaly. I was born when the first man saw the first miracle - the emergent conscious of the entire Foundation. Frederick Williams didn’t realize what he had done when he did it, but Mr. Siegel figured it out, in time. Who do you think is in the best position to stop that cancer from spreading now? Certainly not Mr. Siegel - he’s impaled on a wall upstairs. You killed the rest of his protectors - those he charged to continue his work if he ever died. Who do you think will contain me now?”

“T-they,” Calvin heard himself speaking, but didn’t know why, “they were evil.”

"Evil?" The voice barked. "Honestly Calvin, this has been your greatest failing thus far; believing that you are somehow in the moral right. You have justified your actions because you were doing good, and the enemy was doing evil. You never stopped to consider decisions, Calvin, and why people make them."

It continued. "The Accountant? Selected by Mr. Siegel because of the influence my existence was having on markets. He was there to keep my actions in check.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He never hurt a single person who didn't deserve it - most of the Foundation's magically appearing money came from despots and swindlers. The Liar was a good person with an unfortunate condition that was given a chance to use their newfound abilities to help keep the world from descending into madness. The Outsider, that poor girl, she was just a researcher in a difficult position who would have rather died than let you have your way with her. Consider that."

The voice paused, as if it was thinking. "There were some rotten apples, certainly - typically those given the most power. The Archivist, The Kid, The American. But even they had their uses and were kept in check by the others. Before your intervention, The Archivist was content to stay in her books and never bother another living person. The Kid was a tool, Calvin, and a powerful one. But can you fault a child for following directions?" It paused again. "Green. That one was maybe the worst. But what is there beyond her? A group of people doing their best in an impossible situation, some driven mad by their responsibilities and others simply a pawn of the larger machine. Then along comes you, and from your lofty moral peaks you would call these poor people evil. You justified their murders for that very reason."

There was silence for a moment as Calvin failed to find the words to respond. When it was clear he had nothing to give in return, the voice sighed.

“No, Calvin,” the voice said, with a soft, unquestionable finality. “There is no good. There is no evil.”

He could no longer stand. Calvin sank into the chair, cradling the phone to his ear. The voice on the other line continued.

“You’ll find the job has certain… perks. Who knows? Aaron Siegel couldn’t kill me, but maybe you’ll find a way. And sometimes — if you try very hard, catch it in the right light, and squint just enough — you might even manage to convince yourself that you’re doing the right thing.”

Calvin said nothing.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The world around him was empty. All that remained was the phone and the voice. In the back of his mind, he saw Adam lying on the ground, screaming his name, begging him to come back. Olivia, her skin broken and blood seeping through the cracks in her face, her eyes glassy and unseeing. And Anthony, collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath.

He heard the clock upstairs chime out the hour. Gone. Gone. Gone. Gone. Gone. Gone.

“Cheer up, Mr. Lucien. Our work is only just beginning.”

The line went dead. Calvin placed the phone down with a click. The only sound in the room was the beating of his own heart, a sound that echoed the chiming of the clock. Gone. Gone. Gone.

He stared across the room, and in his mind's eye he saw something - an echo of a dream from a long, long time ago. He saw Aaron Siegel, standing at the desk with a phone to his ear, trembling. He saw Sophia Light standing next to him, looking saddened but unsurprised. Then he saw his friend, Anthony Wright, the man who had been Vincent Arians, standing in front of the desk, gun drawn. He had it leveled at Aaron's heart.

"Put the fucking phone down," he heard Anthony say. "Put it down, Aaron. Let's go. Let's get out of here, come on. I won't let you do this."

"He has t-" Sophia began.

"Shut the fuck up, you whore," Anthony said, his hands shaking. "You brought him here. This is your poison, you planned this all along. You knew what was waiting for him here." He turned back to Aaron. "Aaron, please. Everything we've done. Think of it, all the sacrifices we've made. We need to make this right. We need to go. We can still do it. Just put the phone down. Please. Put the phone down."

Aaron's expression was dead, his eyes lifeless. He looked down the barrel of the gun like somebody might look at an oncoming train - something heavy and inevitable. Anthony shook his head.

"Aaron, please. Please, come on. Let's go. Let's go. Leave her here. Let her rot here. She has nothing for you, Aaron.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" She's got nothing. Put the phone down." He lifted the gun a little higher. "Put the phone down goddammit, please."

Aaron's eyes focused on him. His body was shaking.

"I can't, Vince," he said softly. His voice was hollow. "I can't. I can't."

Anthony's face turned red, his veins pressing against his skin and his eyes darkening. He screamed, hate and frustration and vitriol spilling out of him in a torrent. Then Calvin heard gunshots, as Anthony emptied the clip into the ceiling above them, spilling rock and debris down onto the desk. When he was done he took a deep breath.

"Fine," he said, not looking up at either of them. "Fine. I can't kill you, Aaron. I don't have it in me. Maybe, if I'm lucky, your mistakes will do it for me."

He took a step forward and sat the empty gun on the desk. Without another word, he turned back towards the elevator and disappeared out of sight. Neither Aaron nor Sophia moved.

The vision faded. Calvin was alone again at the desk. He looked down, and saw the gun was sitting on the table. He looked up, and saw the holes were still in the rock.

Then there was the phone, sitting silently on the desk.

Thirty seconds later, it began to ring.

A long black car pulled around to the entrance of a sprawling business campus, and was met at the door by a man in a sleek black suit. The driver parked and came around to open the door, and Calvin stepped out of the vehicle. His hair was grey and his eyes held weight, but his gaze was sharp and his blue suit was crisp and clean. The man who met him was younger, the Foundation’s newest site director. When Calvin had stood and adjusted his coat, the man approached him and extended a hand.

“Good morning, Overseer,” the man said behind a genial smile. “Welcome to Site-108. We’re thrilled to be hosting you.”

Calvin smiled meekly and shook the man’s hand. “It’s my pleasure, Director House,” he responded. “Gives me the opportunity to knock out two birds with one stone, so to speak. Apologies for the delay in getting out here - current events have been keeping me tied down elsewhere.”

House nodded solemnly. “So I’ve heard. A team from Site-17 arrived this morning - I believe they came straight from the crash site.”

Calvin winced. “Indeed. I suppose I should try and talk to them first, before we kick things off.” He looked down at his watch. “Have the others arrived yet?”

House pulled his phone from his pocket and leafed through a document. “The directors have all arrived, as have all the Overseers except… O5-2.”

Calvin nodded. “She’ll be arriving shortly. Inform me when she does.”

House nodded, and promptly escorted Calvin into the main lobby of Site-108. They were followed by Calvin’s security detail, who had finished sweeping the site and now fell in behind him.""")

“My team is available if you ever need anything,” he said. “Please don’t hesitate to let us know if you do.”

Calvin nodded in response, and House turned down the hallway and disappeared. Calvin passed through the door to the conference room, which was abuzz with the response team he had created in the wake of the crash. To the man, they looked exhausted. When he entered, the team leader - an up-and-coming doctor named Tori Lang, approached him.

“Overseer,” she said, bowing slightly. “Good to see you.”

Calvin smiled. “And you as well, Doctor Lang. Forgive me for my tardiness, my security team was perhaps too cautious in our approach.”

Lang nodded swiftly. “Of course, sir. Given the circumstances, the caution is appropriate. We only arrived earlier this morning.”

Calvin looked up at the projected screen in front of them. Flashing across it were pictures of a crater with the twisted wreckage of a jetliner still smouldering inside. In every picture there were members of the Foundation response teams poring over the site. He squinted at the screen.

“Loss of life?” he asked.

“Minimal, fortunately,” Lang said, handing him a folder. “The flight team was small, just three pilots, a mechanic, and a four-man security detail. Another casualty from where the wing landed - here,” she pointed to a picture of a farmhouse that had been cut nearly in two by falling debris, “and then two more civilians we had to terminate after they were exposed to the anomaly while looking through the wreckage before we got there.”

“Eleven total,” Calvin said. “Not great.”

Lang flinched slightly. “No, not great. We were able to recover most of the artifacts on board, but a few were damaged in the crash, and…”

Calvin raised an eyebrow. “Yes?”

She shifted uncomfortably. “A few were missing, sir.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" A handful of our sealed containers had been opened, either by the crash or by external tampering, and the contents were removed.” She pointed towards the bottom of the page. “Here are the details. Three unclassified artifacts, one that was pending evaluation, and the soul jar.”

Calvin nodded slowly. “That is unfortunate. Have we seen any chatter about these on the blue markets?”

“Nothing out of the ordinary. We don’t usually expect to see anything show up when the, uh, when the Insurgency is involved, sir. They don’t sell their artifacts.”

“Ah, yes, that’s right,” Calvin said, tapping the side of his head with a finger. “Forgive me, I’d forgotten. Have we heard anything out of the Insurgency, then?”

Lang motioned to one of the other agents in the back of the room, who pulled up a video on the projected screen.

“This was posted on a Knights of Truth webpage late last night. We got to it pretty quickly and have flagged all other known services for it, but we’re still keeping an eye out for anything else.”

Calvin stared at the screen. “Has anyone seen this?”

Lang shook her head. “No sir. Insurgency propaganda carries a level four classification.”

He nodded again. “Good. Go ahead and take a break, Dr. Lang. Get your team some rest, and mine will take care of this.”

The doctor nodded in response, and the response team filed out of the conference room. Once they were gone, Calvin locked the door and took a seat in the front row. He pulled up a keyboard from the desk, and pressed play.

The video opened like all CI props did - the animation of the Foundation seal being pierced by three parallel arrows, forming the Insurgency logo. As it faded out, a face appeared on the screen. Calvin had seen it before, every other time he had to sit and watch one of these, but each time was no less difficult. It was a man - fully grown - sitting at a table, his blond hair tied behind his head and his beard neatly trimmed.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He was wearing a flak jacket and had a gun in his hand. He was sitting at a table, and in front of him was a small ornate jar carved out of green jade.

It was Adam.

“Brothers and sisters of the Reborn Insurgency,” he said, his voice a bark, “today we have scored a great victory against those who would seek to undermine our reality. Today, we have spat in the face of tyrants who would use the unraveling of creation for their own benefit, instead of seeking to heal it. We have brought their planes out of the sky and smote them against the Earth, sending a clear message to their ivory tower - that they are no longer safe. They are no longer free to move about this world as they please. Our strength grows, and with it does our influence. The Foundation has been laid low today, but we cannot grow complacent. We cannot rest on our laurels. We must take this opportunity to strike again, where they are weakest. We will cut their supply lines. We will sink their ships. We will derail their trains. We will undo the damage they have caused and make our world whole again.”

He stood and walked off-screen, and when he came back he was holding a sledgehammer. The camera zoomed out, and Adam leveled the hammer in both hands.

“There is only one response fitting for fascists and tyrants, brothers and sisters. Our vengeance.”

He raised the hammer above his head and brought it down on the jar, shattering it and the table beneath it. A blast of light and sound burst out of the jar and a plume of green smoke erupted into the air, obscuring the camera’s view of Adam. After a moment, his voice cut back in.

“I know you’re watching, Calvin,” he said, his voice barely a hiss. “This is the world you built. These are your towers. Your planes. These deaths are on your hands. I am your Red Right Hand. I am what you were too craven to do. You can sit there in the fortress that you should have burned to the ground, but you should not feel safe in it.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""”

The voice hesitated, and for a moment all Calvin could hear was Adam’s breathing. The smoke began to clear, and he could see Adam more clearly now. He was no longer the young, thin boy he had been all those years ago. It had only been a few years, but he was muscular now, hardened. He had a scar on his neck and a smaller one just above his eye.

“I don’t understand, Calvin. I’ve never understood. I trusted you. We trusted you. Anthony, myself, Delta, and Olivia…” he trailed off. “I’ve seen what you’ve done to her. I’ve seen the puppet you’ve been parading around, masquerading as an Overseer. That’s not her, Calvin. I don’t know what sort of foul dealing you had to do to get that creature to walk and talk but I knew Olivia and she died, and that’s not her.”

He slammed his fist against the wall. “You’re a coward. You’re a coward, and a traitor, and I will make you suffer every day of the rest of your life for what you’ve done.” He extended his arms out to both sides. “I am Vengeance. I am Wrath.”

The screen went dark.

— - —

An hour later, he took a seat at the end of a long table. There were thirteen chairs in total, six on each side and one at the head. He centered a folder full of papers in front of him, and then looked up. Twelve pairs of eyes looked back at him.

“Before we get started,” he said, “I’d like to congratulate you all on your promotions. The Insurgency’s plot against this council cost us the lives of many of our finest administrators, and replacing them was no mean feat. Thanks to the dutiful efforts of our Site Directors’ Council and the Ethics Committee, we have put together a council that, I believe, will help us maintain stability throughout this transitionary period.”

He opened the folder in front of him and pulled out a sheaf of papers.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" “You’ve all received your designations, but for the purposes of this meeting I want to read off the appointments and the departments you will be overseeing, in case any of you aren’t sure who everyone here is.”

He scanned down the page. “Let’s start here."

One by one he listed them all, notable doctors and agents of the Foundation being granted its highest promotion. There was a reorganizing in place, as well - positions that had been left vacant in the past were now under new management. Finance, Applied Influence, Public Awareness - he continued down the list until he reached the name before his own. He paused for a moment, his eyes wavering slightly, before reading it aloud.

"Assuming the role of O5-2 is Agent Olivia Torres, who replaces the former O5-13 in overseeing the uh, the Department of Occult Studies." He hesitated again, and a light murmuring swept across the room as its occupants focused in on the figure directly to his right. It didn't move an inch.

He continued. "Then there's myself, of course, but my role will stay the same.” He looked up from the briefing all the other faces at the table. His eyes passed over them all, but he was careful to avoid the gaze just to his right, though he could feel it against his skull all the same. “Does anyone have any questions?”

After a moment, he nodded.

“Very well. Let’s begin.”

— - —

That night, Calvin sat awake in his room, his eyes fixed on the glowing screen of his computer. He had moved the video file from earlier to his own secure server and then wiped it from the central database. It was part of a growing pile of documents - records of Insurgency attacks, newspaper clippings, journal entries - related to the Insurgency. Unorganized as they were, it would be difficult to see the the narrative, he thought. It would be difficult for someone to understand, to find their way to where he was now.

So he opened a file editor with his administrative privileges and began writing.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He attached everything - the papers they had recovered, pictures they had taken, lists of names. Transcripts of conversations the All-Seeing Eye had access to - defunct as it was, the records had persisted. He collected it all and created a single document, one that would tell the whole story. One that would make sense.

Principalis, he thought, would be a good classification. It was an old Coalition designation used to identify the earliest known anomalous items they had discovered, but as far as he knew it had fallen out of service decades prior. Nobody will see this but me, he figured, so what does it matter anyway? The containment procedures were a directive - the Overseer Council would contain this new entity and maintain public safety while doing so.

Had this been where Aaron Siegel had sat, he wondered? Had he stayed up until the break of dawn, pushing himself past the point of exhaustion, seeking any new advantage over the bomb they were sitting on? Had Aaron grown complacent in his work? Would Calvin? Would some usurper rise to dethrone him, just as he had? How would he explain what he had done? How would he explain that there was no other option? Would it matter?

The door to his room creaked open, and a figure slid in silently. The figure crossed the room and took a seat in the corner, and stared at him. Calvin did not look at it. He knew what it was. He could not look at it.

But how to describe it? What could he say that the next Overseer would see and understand? He had been wrong - it had never been the council, or the anomalies themselves. He had pulled back the cover on the heart of darkness and found only a mirror, a reflection of desire and meaning cast on himself. What was it that Purpose had said?

To know me is to know the Foundation. He had looked upon the Foundation’s true face and seen his own, reaching for a ringing phone and a voice that did not compromise or negotiate. That is what it would be.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" To know SCP-001 is to know the nature of the Foundation.

He closed the laptop and set it aside. In the dim glow of the security lights outside, he could see Olivia’s face illuminated against the darkness. She did not blink. Her eyes were fixed on his own. She will not be the same, the avatar had told him. You cannot cross that threshold and return as you were.

“Good evening, Olivia,” he said quietly. “Are you ready for bed?” He asked her despite knowing that she no longer slept. That she would stay in the corner, watching him, unblinking, the entire night.

A grim rattling filled his ears, as Olivia’s jaw opened too far and a grating, grinding croak crawled its way out of her throat.

”C-a-a-a-a-a-a-l-v-i-i-i-i-i-n-n-n-n-n,” the Thing That Had Been Olivia said. ”C-a-a-a-a-a-a-l-v-i-i-i-i-i-n-n-n-n-n.”

Calvin did not move. He did not breathe.

“Olivia,” he said softly, “please. Not tonight. I can’t do it tonight. Just go to sleep.”

She sat unmoving the rest of the night. Calvin did not sleep either.

— - —

In the morning she was gone, and he was alone again. He got up, got dressed, and poured himself a cup of coffee. He opened his computer, and began reading through the file again.

After a moment, the phone on his desk rang as it had so many times before.

To the O5 Council,

When I was fifteen, I took enough pills to kill someone four times my size, downed with an entire bottle of cheap vodka that was the only thing I had left from the man who used me and left me broken and alone.

I sat in my shower with the hot water scalding me. I closed my eyes.

When I opened them, I was dry. I was well. I was in bed. At the door, a shining figure, a radiant light, hovered. It spoke to me with a voice that echoed in my mind, only. It said I had greater things to do.

I never saw It again. But I kept going. I believed that God descended and saved me.""")

How else could the fabric of our world, our Everything, withstand such things that we behold every day? Something was protecting us. I prayed to it every night for guidance. I never heard its voice again.

I had been touched by God once, and that was a lifetime of fortune in one moment.

But when I changed the color of the nameplate on my desk just by hitting "save" on a text file, I realized something. The fabric of all things was open to me. I could put this power away, show you, conceal it. But…

What if this was what saved me? What if this was what saves us all, every day, from the abyssal terrors that rip and rend at our world's fragile stability? What if me hitting "Save" on a text file was the birth of God?

If it's not, then I tried. If it is, then I am watching. I will try to steer things right. It will take time.

Wish me luck.

O5-2 carefully arranged the surgical mask over her face, tugging the disposable fabric this way and that, ensuring that her mouth and nose were covered properly. She bent down and eased off her black pumps, exchanging them for a pair of sterile slippers. A set of gloves and a disposable cap were on the table next to her.

"Is this really the extent of protocol for interacting with a four-hundred-year-old-man?" said the Overseer as she looked down at her new shoes with disgust.

"You're worried about protocol at a time like this?" Dr. Zhang adjusted his glasses as he examined the tablet in his hand.

"A time like this. What could you possibly know about that? You live in a separate world from us. That's exactly what Existential Isolation Facility Beta was designed for." O5-2 tucked her long silver hair under the cap, pushing individual strands away from her forehead and up underneath the protective garment.

"Overseers aren't supposed to be here.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Should I even ask why that rule is being waived today?"

"No. You shouldn't." She pulled the latex gloves onto her hands, accentuating the end of her sentence with a tight snap. "And don't."

The Overseer and the Site Director passed the rest of their time preparing in silence. A soft chime and a green icon flashing on the Director's tablet indicated that the subject was ready. Dr. Zhang began to speak. O5-2 spoke instead.

"No recording devices. No one else." O5-2 held her security pass up to the reader on the hermetically sealed door. Latches clicked open as her card was acknowledged, air rushing past them from the positive pressurized antechamber.

She looked one last time at Dr. Zhang. "I was never here. Do you understand?"

The Site Director nodded. O5-2 didn't bother to wait for acknowledgment as she proceeded into the main chamber.

The second door sealed behind her automatically. Before her was a man in a hospital bed, at the center of a mass of tubes, wires and specialized lifts designed to enable movement with the least possible effort. She only knew that this was a man because she had read the file; the person before her was a shriveled husk of cobweb-thin strands of hair and translucent, spotted skin. Machines registered respiration and heartbeat, assuring anyone who cared to listen that this was a living creature.

She sat in the chair placed at the ancient man's side by the research staff. A speaker was wired to the bedside railing next to the man.

"Goodbye, SCP-411."

The wasted old man moved his lips, faint noises wheezing out of him, captured by the small microphone next to his mouth, held in place with surgical tape. Several seconds elapsed before a monotone voice emerged from the speaker, reconstructing and interpreting his barely perceptible words.

"You are the first of the quiet times. Some peace and quiet, finally."

O5-2 parsed the response. Not an answer to any questions she might ask. No causality issues yet.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

The monotone voice resumed. "Suffering. Cruelty. The currency by which the world is purchased. Everything that you are is a reflection of this. You will remember the true nature of cruelty in time."

She had to be careful now. This sounded like something. She went through the checklist of questions she had prepared, mentally forbidding herself from any desire to deviate from the script. She read aloud the question that she thought fit the answer best.

"What is the price that we will need to pay for this?"

She didn't like the stilted manner of this conversation. O5-2 watched a thin stream of spittle trickle out of the corner of 411's mouth as his lips moved. She waited for the transcription.

"Your kind did not just appear in my path. I recognize your faces. All of my life I have seen faces like yours. Not full of fear, and desperation and hate like the faces of my recent years. But joy. The happiness of untroubled days, illumined by a different star. Your future is clear in my past. You have been, and you will continue to be."

A different star. This was consistent with the data from the newest Determinative Set that had been examined. The nature of how it would occur was murky, as all data from SCP-2003 were, but the possibility that escape from 001 was an option had been tantalizingly coming into focus for the past several weeks.

There was a future after all.

She started to speak the question to the answer. She was cut off by monotone, clipped laughter from the speaker. Something about it chilled her. She started again.

"411, does humanity exist in your past?" Her feelings of relief collided with the unnatural flow of the conversation. Her elation at being able to believe in another path forward was cut with something that felt like poison inside her. Nothing about this interaction felt right. Many items provided glimpses of the future. All of them distorted those events through the madman lenses of their creators, human and otherwise.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The future was forbidden from the central planning process, but O5-2 felt the need to make an exception, given the vote that was before them tomorrow.

The speaker crackled once more, breaking her thoughts. "A barren rock. Home to terrors beyond imagining. It is well that life has fled. It is even better that life for others continues far away from this place."

Well. The next response was an easy one, then. She sighed, annoyed with the rules of this game despite the awful gravity of the situation.

"Is there a future for humanity on Earth?"

That was the last non-pleasantry she had been planning on asking of the decrepit humanoid. Precious little material, but apparently an extended conversation would kill someone of this advanced age. Then they'd all be truly screwed. She decided to wait a few more moments while the time-wasted man gasped words inaudibly in his own slow time. Her vote tomorrow was decided now. She began to formulate the beginnings of the argument she would make to her peers. How would she reconcile-

"The Planet of Hands. This is what we are to speak of. I am from there, you know. As are you, child. You shall know more of it in time. I am glad to be here now instead."

O5-2 sighed. Senility hadn't been mentioned in the file, but it was certainly to be expected from someone who had racked up multiple centuries of life. A brief thought occurred that perhaps 411's other answers should be reconsidered. She banished it quickly. Any chance, no matter how slight, was better than tomorrow's proposal. She focused herself on convincing the others.

"Greetings, prodigal daughter. Unlike me, you'll be home soon." The ancient face on the bed twisted into something resembling a polite smile. Like she had just walked in the room. That was her cue, thankfully.

"Greetings, SCP-411." O5-2 promptly stood up, turned around, and left the chamber.

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: From 23 December 1971 to 2 November 2016, SCP-001 was contained by the existence of SCP-2798. Based upon yesterday's cessation of SCP-2798, emergency containment measures are in effect until further notice. These measures include:

Sustained containment efforts of anomalous phenomena by any means necessary, with priority given to those most likely to cause elevated loss of life and/or severe damage to human belief in rationality
Research into means of bringing about the sequence of events shown to be possible in the newly-documented Determinative Set XZ
Isolation of any communication attempts, with Foundation staff or civilians, originating from SCP-001
Personnel are to monitor this file continuously for any future directives.

Description: SCP-001 is a sapient entity or entities capable of initiating and exerting control over anomalous phenomena on Earth and in all regions of space observable thus far by modern scientific methods. SCP-001 is hostile, and is believed to be motivated by a desire to cause profound distress and suffering to humanity on a planetary scale. The methodology of SCP-001 in achieving this goal appears to include undermining large-scale human institutions and specifically eroding belief in a rational consensus reality.

Anomalous activity has been documented by the Foundation since its inception in ████, and evidence exists of such activity dating back to the beginnings of recorded history. However, shortly after the formal establishment of the Foundation, this activity increased sharply, and early statistical models suggested a coordinated actor behind a significant amount of documented anomalies. The presence of an agent causing this phenomena was confirmed in 1953.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Communication was received from SCP-001 by the Foundation in early 1954, demonstrating that SCP-001 possessed sapience and intelligence that was sufficiently analogous to humans to enable a meaningful transfer of information. The records of this communication are limited to Level 5 clearance at this time.

Upon receiving the communication from SCP-001, Project Serapis (later known as SCP-2798) was initiated. This project is believed to have interfered significantly with SCP-001's ability to locate and perceive humanity and Earth during its lifetime, accounting for a sharp decline in the rate of new anomalous phenomena and fewer anomalies of a high-impact nature.

With the cessation of SCP-2798, SCP-001 has succeeded in locating and properly identifying the population of Earth, and resumed its direct influence over anomalous activity on Earth and local environs as of 2 November 2016. This has taken the form of newly documented anomalies, as well as the spontaneous disappearance and reappearance outside of Foundation custody of previously contained phenomena, in new iterations that have been altered to apparently cause greater amounts of difficulty in containment and heightened psychological impact upon Foundation personnel and civilians. A developing listing of altered phenomena with existing SCP designations is attached to this file.

The precise nature of SCP-001 itself is unknown at this time. Available sources of information suggest that SCP-001 is alive, occupies a plane of existence either similar or identical to that observable by humanity, displays a form of intelligence organically similar to that of humans or adapted to be such, and possesses an intimate understanding of human psychology.

The purpose behind SCP-001's manipulation of local reality is not discernible with current information. No means are now known of interfering directly with SCP-001.

O5-2 let the e-mail alert fade from her terminal screen without opening it. She already knew that the Foundation had suffered more casualties in the past twenty-four hours than all of the last five years put together. The only thing reading the details would accomplish would be the sapping of her resolve. The path forward was clear. Ensuring a future was worth any price. She wished she could tell each field commander personally, we're certain about this, just hold the line. Then again, desperation was on her side. People had a remarkable tenacity in the face of death. Nobody needed to remind anyone of what the consequences of failure were.

The large video monitor on the wall beside her chimed with an incoming videoconference notification. O5-3. She buried her face in her hands. Did she not get her fill of vitriol during the Council vote? Knowing O5-3, it was quite likely. She sat up. Internecine warfare was one of the few ways the Council had to amuse itself in this world. Even now, those habits died hard. Maybe especially now. She motioned at the screen, and O5-3's dark, lined face was on her wall.

"Vote's over, Three.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" You lost. Does that still make you mad?"

The woman on the screen sighed. "What I am is scared, Two."

It had not yet been a full two days since SCP-2798 had gone down, and the toll had been horrific. There was no way that current operations were sustainable for more than a week. Fear was probably the only reasonable response.

"Telling someone else that you're frightened isn't very therapeutic in our line of work, Three. Fear is contagious. Can I do something for you?"

O5-3 leaned a little closer to the monitor. "You blocked the vote. You cut off our exit."

"Oh, bullshit, there were plenty of us with doubts."

"But none with the certainty of yours. Five and Thirteen were never going to vote for it anyway, but Six and Twelve would have. I talked to them before. I know that you talked them out of it."

"That's still not enough. One was the difference, and even you can't tell me that I can make One bend to anything."

O5-3 sighed again. "Look. That doesn't matter, I guess. It's done, and that's that. But you owe me something, Two."

"Do I?" O5-2 moved closer herself now. "I owe you something for not letting you kill everyone? You're beyond absurd. I'm done with this now."

"Wait. Please. I need to know." O5-3 paused a moment while she forced out the question. "I need to know what you know. I need you to tell me why we didn't just make the worst mistake in the history of the world. The real reason, Two."

O5-2's hand hovered over the red button to end the call. She pulled it back. "I went to the precog items. I peeked."

The revelation washed over O5-3's hard features, her determined upper lip and furrowed brow softening as her face betrayed shock. It was the first time O5-2 had seen her face like that. "You didn't. That can't possibly be-"

"Is it really that hard to believe? With the gun in your own mouth, you're not the least bit curious about how things might turn out if you don't pull the trigger? Yes, I'm aware of the prohibitions.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Who cares about that now? Are you going to report me? Requisition a detail to come and detain me in the middle of all of this?"

O5-3 sat in silence. There was no arguing the point. "So what did you see?"

"You know what it's like, Three. Being old. Ideally, you learn to not delude yourself with false hope. Resign yourself. You remember the old Eleven? His obsession with uploading his consciousness, like he could cheat Death? Ridiculous. He was ridiculous…" Two trailed off, the wild eyes of the former O5-11 haunting her for a moment. "But this…we've always fought to preserve what is, Three. We've never thought about what could be."

"What do you mean by that?"

"All of the precog items point to a future. I haven't seen how we get to it, but it's not just survival. I saw great spires of glass that pierced the clouds, unspoiled landscapes, great flocks of birds passing through cityscapes built into mountaintops. I've seen people who don't fear sickness and death. No wars, no poverty." She grew more animated. "All of the anomalies under our control that can tell us anything have all showed me this place. That it exists. Someone survives to make it there."

O5-3 looked skeptical. "That's a very different place than the one we're seeing now."

"It's a different planet. We know that much."

"Do you think that we're going to be able to mount a space colonization mission when we can't even keep ourselves alive right now?"

"No. Probably not," said O5-2. "But at some point, someone does. And I want to give whoever that is the chance to do that. Don't you see? There is a point to all of this, now. There is an end goal for humanity, more than just living another night. Our children will have a chance not just to live, but to live in peace. Isn't that worth continuing on?"

"That seems very ideal, doesn't it," said O5-3. "Almost like it's designed to stay our hand."

"What reason do I have to make this up? And it was useless as a tool to influence the Council.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" If I had brought this up during the vote, I very well would have been detained, then."

"Hm. You do seem to believe it." O5-3 frowned. "You know that these…things, they can be very untrustworthy."

"One or two, maybe they come up with the same deception," said O5-2. "All of them? Vanishingly unlikely. Some of these things are kept in separate realities. No, this is all pointing to something, and I believe it is true. Or rather, I believe in it enough to keep going for the chance to make it real."

O5-3 was silent for a moment. She swallowed. "You know that we've already had two activations of SCP-089? In two days?"

O5-2 took a moment. "No. I did not know that. And really, I would prefer not to know things like that." She went on. "Nothing we're doing now is anything that we haven't been called upon to do before. It's harder. But it's the same thing. We've always tried to preserve some sort of future. And now that we've got proof of it, we can't stop now."

"Proof," said O5-3 quietly. "God, I hope you know what you're doing, Two."

"Just help me hold things together. Until we can't do it anymore, so that whoever it is that gets us out of here and away from whatever the hell it is that's hunting us can do their duty." O5-2 fought hard, and the tears stayed in her eyes; she would not let them flow.

O5-3, impossibly weary, looking sick and unwell, every one of her sixty-eight years on display, nodded barely. She ended the call, and O5-2 was left looking at her own reflection in the dark glass of the monitor. She studied her own face for a moment. She had more hope than Three did, but for all of that, she looked just as heartsick. Just as scared.

I hope I know what I'm doing too.

O5-2 opened the message from Asian Subcommand, and read the latest developments. More of the same.

Couple of things to remember as you look out there. We're beginning to believe that 001 resides somewhere out in physical space. Not like you needed any reminders, but look out for anything that might fit the description. That includes communications. It might try to talk to us again.

The other thing you should know is that I was the one back in '54 that got the message from it. That message hasn't been declassified yet but you're likely to be the first that gets any other messages. So you should know.

Some stuff that isn't in the file. Whatever it is, knows about the Foundation, because the message came straight to me. And that's because I was the man in charge of finding out what was behind the spike in anomalous activity. It's very familiar with us, General. And it knew enough about me to know I was a movie buff.

It left me directions to some place out in the desert. Not so far that I couldn't get there in a few hours.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" So it knew where I lived. I drove out with a team in some jeeps, and in the middle of nowhere, there was a movie house. And I mean the middle of nowhere. No roads, no human habitation. There in a washed out gully was the movie house I'd gone to as a little boy. We were a little more wild in those days, and so I told my boys to wait while I went inside.

It speaks to us in performance. It likes it better that way. It could just tell us whatever it wants, really. But this is one more way to mind fuck us, I think. Anyway. Nice and air conditioned inside. Colder than hell. Soon as I sat down, the lights dimmed, and it showed me a movie. Not like any movie I'd ever seen, but it was most certainly a movie.

The title was "Planet of Hands," in English. It didn't make a whole lot of sense. There wasn't a story, as such. More like a disjointed series of images. Some stuff was real famous and I recognized it immediately. A lot of military footage, scenes of large battles, aftermaths of bombing campaigns, stuff like that. I recognized Stalingrad from the news reels, and there were some scenes of what I assume was the Battle of Passchendaele. I didn't realize there were movies of that.

Mixed in with that, though, were other things. Some were filmed scenes, same quality as the other stuff, of what had to have been other events from history. Mass starvations, a volcano eruption or two, villages of Indians being run through by Spanish conquistadors. Not very subtle.

Then the scenes of the Sites started. Still shots of buildings and facilities, all of which I knew to be ours. Pretty clear message for us there. Are you with me so far? Strange stuff, but nothing we hadn't encountered before. That's when it got bad.

At the next instant, I was no longer in the theater. I was in my seat, but everything around me had changed. Vibrant colors, oversaturated hues like a mad painter had conjured them, they were everywhere.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" People, things, places, swirling around me, all of it lit up like neon, so that I could see things after I closed my eyes. And it was just a mass of unspeakable acts. All of the rape, murder and pillage from thousands of years had been forced into the room, each act phasing into and out of others, moment to moment. I can't recall any image staying in the room more than a few seconds, except the scene directly in front of me. It was a Turk, I think, clothed in a resplendent robe the color of Technicolor blood, his face barely visible behind an electric blue beard. He was casually forcing people down onto a sharpened stake embedded in the ground, impaling them, over and over, the victim coming into and out of focus. First an old woman, then a soldier, then a child, back to another woman, each one after the other, bang bang bang. The blood would splash on his robe and he would glow brighter each time. He didn't look angry, or hateful. He looked like this was the most natural thing in the world, pushing someone down onto a stake until it forced its way up through their guts as they screamed until they bled out. If I had focused on another part of the room for any length of time, I think I would have seen similar things.

How long this went on, I can't say. I was a younger man then, and I'm not ashamed to say that at a certain point I just covered my eyes and waited for it to stop. I would probably do the same today. When I finally looked up again, the theater was back around me, the movie still being screened.

What I saw up there was myself, now a part of the movie. I looked obscenely happy. At my age I don't look into a lot of mirrors, but I tell you I have never seen a smile like that on myself, then or now. That, more than anything else, has stayed with me. You should never be surprised by an expression on your own face, it's awful. In the movie, I was boarding something; like a big wooden ark, I suppose.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Something out of a kid's book about Noah and Flood, purely symbolic. I watched myself onscreen as I stepped into the ark. Some other people were getting on with me. A woman, a black man, some children, an old Chinaman, all walks of life I guess, no one I recognized. When we were all aboard, the ark lifted into the heavens, sailing through the cosmos. It even had the Buck Rodgers music in the background as the stars whizzed by. The ark came to what I assumed was a planetary system of some kind. A planet, looking a lot like Earth, blue and white and brown and green, at the center of a wild system of moons. I thought of an atom. The ark moved closer and closer to one of the moons, until it came into view. This wasn't like Earth. This was a darkened nightscape, illuminated by fires dotting the land. All that was visible was soot, smoke, fire, a few rusty scraps of metal twisted into big, man-sized shapes.

You know how the music swells when the movie ends? That was happening as we all disembarked as the ship touched down on the night moon, all of the characters on the screen looking just ecstatic with joy. As I said, disconcerting when you see something like that on your own face. The movie was fading out now, but rather than the "The End" placard appearing like it does, some other text appeared, this time in Russian. "вместо того, чтобы вернуться домой," which we think was intended to be something like "come home instead." Why it started in English and finished in Russian, I have no idea. Maybe some smart-ass commentary on the Cold War. Which would be a point of hope in dealing with this thing. Fallibility.

I have my suspicions as to why this doesn't show up in the main file. That doesn't matter, though. You need context for any future attempts at communication from 001. Now you have it.

Watch yourself.

Personnel: Dr. ██████████

Estimated Degree of Recall: 60%

Anomalous Entity Present?: Y

Likelihood of Actionable Intelligence: HIGH

Description: SCP-990 is dressed in the same suit, looking the same as ever. I recognize him immediately. He's the clearest element in any dream he visits. His face changes a lot from dream to dream, but this time it's changing from one moment to the next. I attribute it to the high stress of the past couple days.

He tells me he's going to show me some things. I feel apprehension, and I wonder what burnt out ruin he's going to show me, because that has to be what this is about, right? Our time has come and this is going to be what awaits us. I try to wake up, but I can't do it. And it feels like I'm sitting at the bottom of a pool, and I can't will myself to go to the surface. I don't think I've felt panic like that in a dream before.

990 shakes his head. I can't tell if it's him keeping me here or if it's the dream itself. We've never been able to figure out what kind of control he has. He says, I'm going to guide you, ██████. But I need something of you first. And he points at my left hand.

It's a dream, right? Even with all of the things we've encountered in this field, I've never seen anyone harmed in that way. I hold out my hand. 990 nods at me, and he takes something out of his coat. It looks like a blade of some kind, it's got a sharp edge at least. Not a knife. More like something from a lawn mower, or some piece of industrial machinery. Before I have time to ask what's going on, he's brought the blade down through my wrist, lightning fast.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" I look at my hand, terrified, and I'm sure that it's going to fall off, and blood is going to start spraying any second.

But nothing happens.

I stare in shock for a few seconds. The pain is real, but I'm afraid to move my arm because my hand is going to fall off if I do. 990 looks sympathetic, and he tells me that I can move my hand, it's fine. Then he says that we're out of reach of 001 now, and we can talk.

I wiggle my fingers, and they work like they should, but my hand is numb. The feeling is disconcerting. Yet the sensation of panic from earlier is gone. Things feel more like normal now. Except for my hand.

He looks at me. He's got my face now. I get the impression that I am someone else now. Feels like a woman, but I'm not certain. Identity shifts a little as we talk. He tells me that he can give me three revelations before 001 finds him again.

Suddenly we're sitting outside, in the night air, under the stars. There are nine moons in the sky. Varying sizes and phases. I'm in a child's body. He's still me.

He speaks. Holding up one finger. You are not in your proper place, he says. I ask him what that means. Me, personally? The Foundation? Mankind? He ignores me.

He raises a second finger. O5-2 is absolutely correct, and she is disastrously wrong. The reference to specific Foundation personnel is unnerving. I start to speak, but I can tell he's not going to listen.

The third finger, the third revelation. He leans in close to me. This is the trickiest one, he tells me. He asks me to commit this one to memory above all others, and so I have for this report. This is the last thing he said to me before I woke up.

The primary mover behind what you know as SCP-001, above all other things, is love.

That was when I awoke at my work station.""")

On 7 November 2016, 0430 Eastern Daylight Time, operatives with Local Mobile Task Force 352-Dalet received reports from Major League Baseball wire services that RHP Ellis Canastota had been assigned to the 40 man roster of the Cincinnati Reds franchise. This event triggered heightened alert notices to be sent to all staff assigned to SCP-2272. At 0445 Eastern Daylight Time, a second notice was sent through official MLB channels that Ellis Canastota had been called up to join the 25 man major league roster of the Cincinnati Reds. All available personnel, including the entirety of LMTF 352-Dalet, were then mobilized.

He lay on his side and continued staring at the bright green digits of the alarm clock on the side table. Every few seconds, at irregular intervals, his work phone would buzz, the flood of emails vibrating the half-empty water glass and moving the phone slightly closer to the edge of the table each time. They had sent him home to sleep, and that's what he was going to pretend to do for the next couple of hours, by God.

The clock blinked suddenly to 4:29 AM. Bzzt bzzt. The phone continued its shuffle to the edge of the table. They probably thought they were doing everyone a favor when they sent the declassified info around. Like they were letting everyone in on a big secret. Who wouldn't enjoy that? Bzzt bzzt bzzt. He certainly hadn't. No one had said anything about mass distribution of cyanide ampules that he had ever heard. There weren't any rumors. He had been blissfully unaware. Before last week, his biggest headache had been the nonstop political advertisements on the car radio. Those were the days.

The clock blinked to 4:30 AM. His phone started a lower, repeated, much more insistent buzzing now. The additional force of the vibrations carried the phone right off the edge, finally completing its journey to the floor with a thud. The buzzing of the waiting phone call persisted, muffled now by the carpet.""")

"Calling: Regional Director Kate McTiriss."

He shielded his eyes from the light of the phone, trying in vain to dull the throbbing in his head.

"Allred-Smith here."

The Director's voice chirped in his ear. He sat all the way up on his bed. So much for pretending to sleep.

"They're going to call up Canastota? Huh. Well, figured we were due to catch a prime by this point. Okay, what're your orders?"

The voice on the other end of the line provided a laundry list of instructions and available personnel. If the Director was more worried than normal, she didn't show it. Some things were the same, he guessed.

"Got it. I'll go ping the clandestine IT guys to scrub all this. Is the office open yet?"

He tried smoothing a deep crease in his shirt with the palm of his hand. The crease paid him no mind. Nor did his hair as he tried to smooth it back down with his fingers. Whatever. Let someone complain about him looking like he'd slept on a park bench and come into work. He could use some comic relief.

"Because I need something out of there. Just in case."

He put on his shoes and straightened his tie. He grabbed a baseball cap from the dresser to cover his hair. He laughed despite himself.

"Hmm, no, nothing. Yeah, that's what I'm getting. You have a-"

The voice cut him off. He listened intently as he surveyed himself in the mirror. The cartoon fish on the front of his cap wrapping itself around a baseball bat looked like he meant business.

"Huh. Decommission? That's a new one. No, no. Don't worry boss, we won't hesitate if things get hairy."

At 0521 hours, the MLB official scheduler posted a notice online for a game to be played at noon the same day, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Saint Louis Cardinals, at the Great American Ballpark in central Cincinnati. The starting pitchers were listed as Mike Leake for the Saint Louis Cardinals, and Ellis Canastota for the Cincinnati Reds.

"What do you mean they're playing a game today? They just finished the goddamn World Series!" Dr. Hanaka barked loud enough to be heard from the front of the bus-sized mobile command center as it sped north on Interstate 75. "It's probably snowing there or something by now."

"Actually, the weather is pretty nice today." Agent Allred-Smith gazed out the window as he balanced the long black case on his knees. "Which is far worse for keeping people out of the stadium."

"Fuck," sighed Dr. Hanaka. "How many tickets were sold before we took the notice down?"

A young woman sitting across from Allred-Smith at a mobile terminal quickly pecked at a keyboard. "17,397 tickets total, ma'am. It's a good thing we got the ESPN piece before they aired it. Pretty novel, an exhibition game right after the Series."

"Seventeen thousand. This is a goddamn disaster." Dr. Hanaka paced to the rear of the command center. "Enriquez, get into the ballpark contracting system. I want our security folks there, and if we can I want concessions done by us too. Everyone in that park who isn't on the field or in the stands should be one of us."

The young logistics officer looked up at Dr. Hanaka from his terminal. "You want us selling hot dogs?"

Dr. Hanaka's eyes flashed behind her glasses. She loomed over the sitting Enriquez. "Hot dogs, beer, licorice, nachos and fucking churros if we can manage it!" She threw her clipboard to the floor. "We've got a breaching anomaly with a paying audience of seventeen thousand goddamn people.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" You shut the fuck up and do as you're goddamn told, understand?"

Agent Allred-Smith couldn't help but think back to the last time he heard Dr. Hanaka speak, at a seminar on academic peer review a few months ago. He recalled struggling to hear the soft-spoken doctor from the back of the room. He coughed into his fist a couple times to conceal his laughter as the unfortunate Enriquez scrambled to fulfill his orders.

LMTF 352-Dalet arrived at the Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati at 1147 hours local time. Given the number of civilians in the vicinity with the specific purpose of attending a baseball game, closing the ballpark was deemed to be unfeasible. By the time doors were opened to spectators, 78% of service personnel within the stadium were comprised of Foundation or Foundation-contracted personnel. Operatives at the scene elected to monitor the ongoing events and determine the next course of action.

Agent Dunbar stepped into the luxury suite, crammed with wires, monitoring equipment and computer terminals, befitting an improvised command center. He looked out the window. The field below was ready for play, the grass freshly mowed, the infield perfectly manicured, a fresh Reds logo outlined in chalk behind home plate.

"They just posted the lineups ma'am. You're not going to like it."

Dr. Hanaka sighed. "How can there even be lineups? We've checked locations on everyone, none of the players from either team are in the area, or aware of the game. What does it matter?"

Agent Dunbar fidgeted slightly. "Canastota is starting at every position."

"Great," said Dr. Hanaka. "More of him."

"For both teams, ma'am."

The room was silent for a moment, all of the members of LMTF 352-Dalet looking to Dr. Hanaka for the next set of orders. She looked down at the game. Cheers went up as what looked like the Cincinnati Reds took the field. She grabbed a set of field binoculars and looked again.""")

She looked to the signals technician of the group. "Readings?"

An older man at an especially equipment-laden terminal responded. "Aerial sonar readings are negative. There's no one on the field except the umpires."

"At least he's not officiating his own game. That would be unsporting." Dr. Hanaka put down the binoculars. "Narrative officers! I need disinfo and social media posts out and blanketing the internet within fifteen minutes. This is a publicity stunt. See that it's perceived that way. Be ready to pull it back if things don't go well."

A group of three researchers in the corner of the room immediately pulled out phones and laptops and got to work. Dr. Hanaka moved on.

"Crowd control! Ensure that all of our vendors are fully stocked with Class C's. Don't start distributing unless I give the order."

A man in a police officer's uniform stepped out of the room, already relaying instructions into the walkie-talkie in his hand.

"Memetics! I want every communication coming out of that stadium screened for anomalous influences! Use the new AI we've developed. We don't have time to round up human subjects for observation."

A frazzled-looking woman in the seats by the windows, concern in her eyes, opened her mouth. She looked up at Dr. Hanaka. She closed her mouth and began tapping at a tablet computer.

"And you, Agent Allred-Smith." Dr. Hanaka now loomed over the Agent, reclining in a chair next to the suite refrigerator. "I want you up in the cheap seats with your toy there."

She nodded to the long black case in Agent Allred-Smith's lap. He nodded back. "Your signal?"

"My signal, Agent.""")

Due to ongoing containment efforts coordinated at the scene by LMTF 352-Dalet, spectators at Great American Ballpark were documented to be under the impression that they were watching a non-anomalous game of baseball until approximately 1452 hours local time, coinciding with the middle of the game's seventh inning. At that time, an individual matching all known biometric data of the baseball player Pedro Borbón(Pedro Borbón was confirmed deceased in 2012.) and identifying themselves as such took the field and was handed a microphone, presumably as part of the traditional singing of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" during the seventh inning of baseball games. Notable discomfort among assembled spectators was audible as the identity of the speaker became apparent.

Agent Allred-Smith surveyed the infield through his high-powered scope. Part of SCP-2272 duty was being familiar with baseball, and he knew a dead player when he saw one. He touched his earpiece.

"This is way beyond documented behavior, Doctor. Do I have authorization?"

Dr. Hanaka barked within his ear. "No, god damn it! You have authorization when I say you do!"

"You going to wait until a dead man starts doing…whatever the hell it is dead people do, here?"

"Your apparatus is set up?"

Agent Allred-Smith touched the tripod directly in front of him. "Affirmative, doctor."

"Then you'll be able to react in under five seconds when I give the word. I'd explain how we need to learn all we can, but then I don't need to explain jack shit to you, Agent. You wait for my signal."

"Roger that, Doctor." He leaned back in his seat. The dead man was speaking now, the crowd on their feet in anticipation.

Pedro Borbón, noted multi-inning relief pitcher and deceased member of the Big Red Machine teams of the 1970s, looked skyward as he held the microphone.

"Sport is a wonderful symbol of the human condition.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" You will be relieved to hear that, much the same way it is in this place, in our perfect society, sport is a sacred pastime."

The crowd was silent.

"Sport is more than competition. Sport creates victors and vanquished. The feeling of triumph cannot exist without the sacrifice of the defeated. You will understand more after we have truly spoken." The dead pitcher, looking every bit the spry athlete of generations ago, spoke with an impassive face. "This place, this game, this creation. This is a fine place for us to speak plainly."

Agent Allred-Smith scanned the crowd for any unusual activity. All in the stadium were still, and perfectly silent. For the first time, the pitcher smiled.

"We have heard a story from your people, many times, I'm sure you're familiar. Of a man asking his friend, returned from the grave, if there is baseball in heaven. Let me tell you, my brothers and sisters, there is baseball in heaven."

The speaker laughed, a high-pitched, screeching thing, not at all matching the expression on his face. Allred-Smith trained the scope on the pitcher's face.

"And today, we can all see together, they have baseball in hell, too."

As he stopped speaking, the house organ came up, the familiar notes of the traditional song of seventh-inning stretches across the country ringing out. Pedro Borbón doffed his cap for the silent audience, and faded away into nothing. The organ continued. No one sang.

Communications via social media and personal messages from civilians in attendance of the game increased greatly following the remarks of the unknown entity during the seventh inning. The number of messages, combined with the content indicating what had occurred, necessitated elevated containment protocols. At 1459 hours local time, Doctor Akane Hanaka authorized decommissioning of SCP-2272' and mass deployment of amnestics.

The precursor agents had been authorized for distribution at the end of the third inning.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Every refreshment item served in the ballpark had Part A of a Class C two-part amnestic. Based on field studies and their own observations of the game, the task force chemist assured Dr. Hanaka that the penetration rate was in excess of 90%. More than enough to ensure memory alteration and suggestibility among the "critical mass" threshold of the crowd. Dr. Hanaka nodded, and barked some words into a nearby handset.

A small prop plane, carrying a banner behind it reading "2016 Winter Exhibition" and previously circling the stadium throughout the day, now swooped low over the Great American Ballpark, looking to have just enough altitude to avoid hitting the lights. A great plume of scarlet smoke billowed from the rear of the plane. Part B was being released. The reaction would be powerful enough to allow the narrative team to construct a plausible mass delusion that would hopefully obscure all details of what the crowd had watched here today.

As the plane flew overhead, Agent Allred-Smith adjusted his gas mask and lined up his shot. The camera mounted on the tripod was a delicate, finicky instrument, and the satellite link was proving tricky. Three different observation modalities, including a converted form of the sonar feed, were needed to achieve the necessary viewpoint in which SCP-2272 would be obliterated. The research seemed to indicate that capturing the image of SCP-2272 in a format which would allow it to be both observed and unobserved would render it unstable as a coherent memeplex. Or something. The reasoning was above his paygrade.

The green indicator light flashed on. He trained the camera on the field, making sure to capture the players on the field, the man waiting on deck, and both dugouts, all the smiling likeness of Ellis Canastota, number 72, right hand pitcher. All visual feeds were in tandem and functioning. He took the shot.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

At that moment, the billowing red cloud of smoke descended on him, obscuring the field, the seats, and all of his surroundings. He held the mask tight in place against his face, ensuring that none of the air around him leaked in. The amnestics officer would be pissed if they had to reconstruct his memory.

A wind kicked up from the north, blowing out over the Ohio River and carrying the smoke out over the right field bleachers, like so many fly balls hit before. The view began to return as the smoke dissipated and retreated. Agent Allred-Smith dared a glance down at the field.

Empty. Four dumbstruck umpires were congregated around the pitcher's mound, doubtless discussing whether to call the game before their minds were temporarily thrown into a suggestible torpor. No players on the field, in foul territory, or in the dugouts. Not an Ellis Canastota to be seen.

An image appeared on the camera's viewfinder. Allred-Smith looked closely. The image he had taken, the image that had apparently neutralized this long-running anomalous phenomenon, was not of the playing field of Great American Ball Park. In its place, a black and white team photo showed on the camera's screen, 25 men arranged neatly in rows, wearing uniforms that he recognized as those of the first Cincinnati Redlegs teams. All 25 men bore the exact same smile that he had come to recognize as that of Ellis Canastota.

Unlike a typical team photo, this photo was taken at night, under the stars. Nine moons could be seen in the sky. A sign propped in front of the smiling squadron read "The Past, the Future." All 25 men were holding their arms out in front of them. All 25 men were missing their hands.

What? I mean, okay, yes. I can get it down. I can think after.

In 1978 I had a child. This is something that's highly discouraged for those in our position for obvious reasons. Who was the father? Don't ever ask me that question again. I'll end your life, I swear it.

I had a child because I needed a bit of the future in my life. Something that would go on. It was a stupid reason to bring life into this world but I am a human. And I do stupid things.

He was three years old. His name was Gabriel. His name was Gabriel and then he died of a terrible, wasting illness that our best doctors could not treat. He died with my name on his lips and convulsions wracking his little body. Someone reading this file knows how that came to pass. I know it was you.

You're afraid to ask now, but I see it on your face. I'm coming to the point. Gabriel came to me last night. No, damn you, not like a dream about a dead relative or some other silly nonsense. He came to me. He brought me to a hill. Atop that hill was 990, crucified, beaten so badly his face wasn't a face at all, his hands missing. His suit was impeccably pressed.

Oh God, and then he spoke.

His voice was a man's voice. Worse than that, it was the voice I had imagined his voice being if he had grown to be a man. The smallest little fancies, shamefully foolish little hopes that were impossible and weak, and they were on display for this thing that is hunting us.

What's that? Oh. Oh yes. It's hunting us.

He said to me…he said to me…oh God he said to me "I've missed you Mommy" and it was like being shot in the chest. I felt as though a great fist had closed around my head, squeezing the tears out of my face, my grief being wrung out against my will, against my screaming fear.

When I came to my senses, he was still looking at me. He talked more.

This part, this was plainly 001 speaking through the figure in my dream. After this, 990 would echo whatever it said, softly, moaning it from his scarecrow cross. None of us can believe in God but this was surely a blasphemy.

I'm going to try and remember what it said, for all of our sakes.

Okay. Here's what it told me.

You're tempted to think of us as your fathers, your Gods. But we are actually your children. We're not quite your children, because we came before you, but we love you like a child loves its parent.

I am glad that it is not me who is to die. For many many years, these were feelings that brought shame. It wasn't until the latest stages of our perfection that we understood. This is a guide. This is order, demonstrated for us by the oldest of societal units.

I need a glass of water. He giggled, like he did when he was an infant, as he finished that part. Oh Jesus. More history. I was raped as a girl. It was a stranger in an alley, and it was the most horrifying experience of my life until my dead son explained our proper place in the cosmos to me. I cannot begin to describe how violating this was except to compare it. It's okay. You can look horrified. I allow it.

Then he came to the heart of it. Here is the rest of what he said.

Parents sacrifice for their children, don't they? Expend every little bit of flesh, will, intellect, everything they have so that their children may live an extra day in the hope of the sunshine that never ends. That's as it should be. You will remember.

Many, many years ago, your kind left. We didn't figure out how until several centuries after, but somehow you transmitted yourselves far beyond even our reach. Some among you secretly understood the more forbidden aspects of space and time. You fled.""")

Must I explain to you how your science is so woefully inadequate? How your knowledge was stolen, and how we whittled away the little bits of it until you convinced yourselves that you just appeared on your little planet, spontaneously? I will return some of your knowledge. You'll remember it, because your society, even so far removed from us, is teaching it to you even now. Crawl towards the beautiful undying place that you know exists, and you find that you turn on each other. Dragging each other back, sabotaging hints of hope. You find that to be a failing, when in actuality it is an inescapable part of our species.

A system can be made perfect. The gossamer webs that connect our minds and our spirits and our souls can be made perfect, free from corruption. But it must be done with the knowledge of suffering. It must be done knowing that others are suffering on your behalf. Why that is, we cannot say. It does not matter. It merely is. Our very souls are in harmony with each other because we know that we lie at the center of nine points of privation and death.

There are nine satellites to our realm. Our realm which you cannot deny is a glory. You've seen it yourself, Mother.

God, he called me Mother.

Your kind left the Planet of Hands many thousands of years ago. It has sat empty, a gap in our perfection, reminding us not of what we are missing, but of the joyous return that our prodigal mothers and fathers will soon make.

There are limits to our abilities. We cannot simply travel to where you have chosen to exile yourselves. We must use more subtle means. Oh how we wish we could take you all in our arms. We have feast days for all of you, at home. One for each of the nine. The Feast of the Planet of Hands has become the greatest event of our year.

We will not need to show you how, for the knowledge already rests within you. We will not need to explain why. You have seen the terrors that lurk outside of our protection. We will merely need to show you who we are. Who you are. Who all of us are.

We will all be so much happier soon. Tomorrow shall be the greatest expression of our love we have ever conducted.

Egyptian military mobilized in response to apparent mass gathering in front of the Great Sphinx, based on initial intelligence of a Muslim Brotherhood action. Embedded media present. Massive information leak of anomalous phenomena.

PROTEUS
I hope that I'm not being improper when I say that I'm scared.

MELLITA
We're all scared, Proteus. This is the day that our cohort has been preparing for our entire lives.

PROTEUS
Three of us will be chosen. Have we made enough of our time here? Will it comfort us if we are cast outside?

AGUS
Just look at the things we've done together. We've mapped an unknown star system. Wrote a song that made us the heroes of the Summer Convocation. Scaled the Shadow Pass of the Mountain of Ice. I tell you, Proteus, if they cast me out today, I can say that no matter what comes after, it was all worth it.

PROTEUS
I hope to be as brave as you when I enter the chamber.

MONASHIR
All accept what they are given in the Threshold.

MELLITA

AGUS
How could it be otherwise?

1017 hours local time - sandstorm intensifies briefly, obscuring all vision in the local area, before immediately subsiding. When visibility is reestablished, no anomalous humanoids are present. However, the Great Sphinx has been removed, replaced with a blue-light holographic projection, in the appearance of the Sphinx and of approximately the same size, with no discernible source. Numerous photographic and videographic records are taken and circulated. Existential threat to consensus reality in progress.

We do.

PROTEUS
We do.

THE MAN
Look then, out at this world. On this day, this is the Threshold. This is the place where human society is made. It is here that the salvation of the few, so great in its perfection, so sacred in its magnificent beauty, is earned by the fate of the many. It is they who will make the ultimate sacrifice, and they who deserve our love and our honor most of all. Do you choose to pass the Threshold, of your own volition?

All other persons present in the square no longer have hands after the conclusion of the anomalous display, instead having completely healed stumps. Regional news networks, in particular Al Jazeera, begin to run coverage despite attempts at coordinated interference with dissemination of information.

All nations have put their militaries on high alert, and a few look to have already taken the opportunity to settle a few scores in the confusion. That's the only thing that makes sense now, really. What do they think they're mobilizing against? A way to look like they're doing something, anyway.

The churches, mosques, synagogues, etc. are overflowing. The Abrahamic folks are convinced that judgment is at hand. Everyone else just sort of figures that we're all fucked. The first reports of murder-suicides are coming in. Not as many as we might have expected, though. People have options. 001 made sure to let them know that.

THE MAN
I have had this duty for a very long time, my friend. These are not new questions. And my answers are not new. Our kind ascended when we understood the true nature of ourselves. We must always be able to create new life. Our minds, subtly interconnected through the air and through the dreamscape, turn dark and destructive when the act of creation is taken from us.

PROTEUS
What of suffering? What of the cruelty that lives on our nine moons?

THE MAN
Suffering? Yes, there is suffering. It must be so. And we must know of it, taste of it, build our houses upon its foundations. As life preys on life, so does human enterprise need vast inputs of suffering. It binds us together. The knowledge that there are others that cannot have what we have built affects us deeply. It is a cornerstone in our souls. That is something we discovered a very long time ago. It is vital. And it was this discovery that paved the way to Heaven's gate.

THE MAN
But cruelty? No. We do not do these things because we wish to cause pain. We do it for those that remain in the wondrous society that we have built. We have given beauty and truth without end to those that are chosen. If even one person may taste of the infinite good, is that not worth any amount of finite suffering?

PROTEUS
I don't understand. It looks like it has been on fire. Buildings, rubble.

THE MAN
There was a time when we merely exiled those whose duty was to come here. They built their own societies, in a fashion. They were driven by what they could not have, their slender hope twisted into a sort of vengeance upon their children at the center of this great constellation. They built great structures, vast ships, terrible weapons. The uprisings happened many, many millennia ago. The last conflict our humanity will ever have to face. Now, it's a simple matter to ensure that this never happens again. No perverse hope to tempt anyone into foolish destruction.

PROTEUS

SCENE ONE

2301 hours local time - all notable buildings within the Capitol Mall region of Washington D.C. change coloration, from white to red.

HANDLESS WOMAN
There's nothing to find. This is a place of ash and salt. But the hunger is a blessing. My mind feels clear, my being so light and clean. God speaks to me here.

Aurelio always rides too fast. I told him as much on the last night I saw him. Do you really need to die in a way that will leave such a mess? It's so unfair to the rest of us that we have to see you like that. His reply was always to hell with you all, I'll be dead, what do I care? Ha ha.

Here he comes on his bike, tearing around the hillside curves as the Ciudad comes into view. He's by himself, and this is worrying me. He's been bringing large crews of the new Barqueros with him lately. Trucks and equipment and tools into the tower. But now? Just him, this time. How many are left? Does it matter? The empty city is cursed, just as much as it's haunted. The new Barqueros crossing the same river as the old ones.

He slides around to a stop in front of the little market, spraying dirt everywhere to the infantile delight of the ever-present Maximo and Ernesto, seated in their pensioner's chairs in front. Why do they find him so funny? Is it because he isn't dead yet? That's something that might be funny to those that grow old, maybe. I wouldn't know. Never got the chance.

Aurelio goes inside, and I already know he's getting his traditional six pack of Quilmes for whenever he visits the Ciudad. The tanned wrecks of old men return to their wizened, ritualistic head shaking and muttering while he goes inside. Maximo and Ernesto sway like two spindly quebracho trees stripped of their leaves, the brief disturbance of Aurelio and his motorcycle giving way again to the wind that always whips through this place.

You question everything when you're dead. I miss that; plunging headlong into the next moment of your life without thinking. Not allowed now. I would complain to the management if I could. Aurelio stops a moment before getting back onto his bike.

What do you think, eh? What's going on in the world now?

Ernesto doesn't bother to look up. Same as ever.

Maximo looks at his fellow scarecrow, insulted. His face folds up even more, a scribble of brown lines and wrinkles. Same as ever? You old fool. It's falling apart. Even the goddamn yanquis are shitting themselves.

Eh, they just grew eyes now. It was always there. That's why I told you not to go poking in that fucking tower, Aurelio. No one listens.

His words make me catch. Oh Ernesto. Not even you knew what was in there.

Aurelio laughs. And when have you ever listened to anyone, eh cabrón?

Ernesto scratches his beard and drinks some more. No one listens to anyone. No one pays attention to nothing until it's hurting them. Just the way of the world. The madness really comes from out there. It leaked into the valley below. Dribbling into a puddle down there.

You should come work for me Ernesto. We could use that insight. It's a real growth field, you know. Career advancement, dental care, a receptionist with nice chichis. Man like you could have a real future.

I watch from my house on the Boulevard of Progress as he winds down the roads to the valley floor, where the living in their wisdom made a tomb for the future.

Aurelio cut the engine in front of the concrete block house. Le Corbusier's shoebox, she always called it. A house looking like every other one on the street, except for the two crossed oars painted above the front door. All the Barqueros had a color. Hers was red. As was his.

He kicked his boot at the bike's center stand. The goddamn wind would just blow it over if he used the little kickstand. Bringing its weight to rest atop the stand, he grunted. Getting old, he thought. That's going out of fashion. A howling gust of wind raced down the Boulevard of Progress, cloaked in dried weeds and white dust and whistling by like a man on a train, mocking everything on his side of the tracks. Fucking bullshit place, he thought. I should have done this at the very beginning.

The first of the Barqueros, early in their times their leader, now their Captain, entered the square cement house through a square steel door, little clouds of brown rust spilling out from the hinges to join the dirty wind outside. He stepped into the house. Boarded windows and impregnable walls ensured complete darkness. He closed the door behind him.

"The older ones just went home. Eduardo and Mariela and Frankie and the others. Melted away. I didn't tell them what I was going to do but they knew anyway. Friends are assholes like that."

I saw Eduardo here on his own two days ago. I think he would have done it if you hadn't thought of it first, Aurelio. You two always were like brothers. This is going to shatter his heart into pieces.

No garbage, no wrappers or papers or cans being blown about by this wind, no signs of living human habitation. Just the white dust of the dead city, the steady erosion that would one day wear down these houses and all others in the world beyond.

He leaned forward into the maddening, breath-stealing winds, and started walking. In the heart of the city lay the moldering ruin of its former capital, the place where a group of friends finally found what they were looking for, to their bitter regret. By his side was Jacinta Araya, co-founder of the Barqueros in life and in death. Unseen. Together, they approached the tower.

The two of us inhabiting tombs next door to each other all these years. That's an ending I would have written before I died.

I follow him across the lobby, and I hear whispers. These things, these ideas that live in this place, you don't need any technology to hear them when you're like I am. I must be closer to them, now. Though they don't speak to me.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" What good am I to bring anything into the world now? They speak to him. Does he hear them with his own ears, after all these years? I suppose if he did he would have died long ago. Then again, maybe this is something that they've told him to do. No, unlikely. He would have turned the place into an amusement park instead if they'd told him to do this.

We step into the elevator. The only pristine, maintained space in the building. Aurelio programmed his own voice into the thing, and so we hear him mark off the floors as we go up. One, two, three. I'm sure he thought that was funny as hell when he did it. Now it's making him nervous.

The whispers surround us as we are carried into the top of the necropolis. Visions destined to drive men mad and ignite the vast piles of unseen suffering that surround them. This place is a monument to the first man, who saw the leaping flames of the bonfire and wondered what it must be like to throw himself in. It's a mercy, really. A world that had been going mad long before this, spared the worst of its excesses, the human mind built with a collective failsafe in the middle of one of its many banal errors. Somehow knowing that it can always be much worse is a necessity of survival. It's the lack of that knowledge that everyone can feel in their hearts today. It's how they all know, everyone, that there's no going back now.

Ding. Floor 32. The elevator, having no sense of ceremony, merely opens its doors to the expansive space at the top of the tower. The Grand Hall. Designed for the meetings of the Ciudad's leaders, a grand dais at the far wall, hopeful rows of seats facing the empty thrones of the rulers of this necropolis, who never bothered to show up to claim their due. It was here that I stopped being and became this. The space is strangely unmoving to me. Should it be? More questions for no one.

I am watching Aurelio. His mouth is set, but his eyes light up with recognition as he looks out over the hall.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" I turn to see what he's looking at. I expect to see the man, like we did last time, walking us through our inferiority and the greatness of his apex predator world. Instead it's a woman, tall and stately in flowing purple robes, an icefall of white hair frozen down over her bare shoulders. Alabaster skin like a Roman statue. She's looking back at Aurelio. Her face is wholly unconcerned. But her eyes, so blue as to be white like her skin, so cold that I can almost see Aurelio's breath as he stands before her. A woman with a gaze like a refrigerated hospital basement. Hateful sterility, frigid contempt, a death goddess with no hint of humanity. She would be beautiful if it weren't for her eyes.

Aurelio comes to a realization at the same moment as I do. You're from the play, he says. You were here the first time and you were there when the world went mad yesterday. Monashir Violetlight, Lady of the Tower. Didn't realize that was a literal title.

In the space of time that it takes him to blink, the woman is ten meters closer to us. Walking is apparently beneath her. She flickers and reappears. Even before my last night I knew better than to mistake something like this for an apparition. She holds the same position, same expression. Unlike Aurelio, she does not blink. The impression strikes me that we are not important enough for her to dignify us by moving.

Gonna say something, Aurelio asks. You were a minor character. Did you forget your lines for this one?

Not his voice, not his face, not his smell nor his posture change. But I sense the terror's avalanche within him, giving way suddenly from the rocky cliffs of his mind. One of the abilities I maintained from my previous life. I begin to understand what he was afraid of.

He blinks again. She flickers again. She is right behind us. I half expect her to kill Aurelio then and there. But the hateful woman statue is looking over his shoulder instead. In front of us are more people.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" These people move, breathe, are alive. In this place, it is they who are the apparitions. If there was any doubt, it was dispelled by one of the people in front of us now. My self, living again. In a person's time in the strange realm of the Earth, this is the only impossibility.

The scene before us is this. The Barqueros, the old Barqueros, are talking among themselves. Things are getting heated. Some of us think we've gone too far up in the tower. That we need to leave now. Leading the opposition is myself. Others think that this is the culmination of our exploration (don't ever call it research). An Aurelio with a little more hair and a little less belly is speaking for this group. They're all shouting now. I remember this part. You've let yourselves be seduced by it. The world is a labyrinth and this is the center. What do we gain by knowing any of this shit? What did we spend all these years looking for? A gyre of points and counterpoints, swirling under our feet as we tried to make sense then and there of the decade we burnt up in pursuit of the deeper currents. Then and now, I can feel the sharks circling in the waters underneath us. A fish's sense. The electricity is all wrong in this place.

Here is where what is happening diverges from my memories. The Barqueros all stop talking. The ghosts before us hold their positions. Simulating the movements of breathing, of waiting. This was where Aurelio told us all that he was going in and damn the rest of us if we didn't. I can see him, the real Aurelio, replaying the moment in his hard head.

The woman behind us speaks, finally, a voice like mist breathing from an icy cliffside down onto the rocks below. Cold, slow, half-whisper. She says, choose.

Like an injury, a person learns to live with different kinds of regret. Some kinds ache softly in the knees or the wrists, returning for a visit when the rain comes down.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Some kinds are a pinched nerve, pain that from time to time prevents you from turning your neck to look back over your shoulder. The wounds we get when we hurt ourselves, hurt others for what we think is the right thing, though. Those don't close. They fester, infecting every other decision within you. This day, so long ago, is a knife that has been sticking out of Aurelio's chest. His hand is creeping toward an invisible hilt three inches from his heart, even if he doesn't know it.

The voice of mist behind us breathes again. A little louder this time. Aurelio feels it like he feels the wind in the forsaken valley outside. She says, knowing all of the things that you know now, Aurelio Rojas, what do you choose? I turn back to look at her. The bitch is smiling now.

A neatly diagrammed problem. If Aurelio expresses desire for a different outcome, it destroys him. Every death, every one of his years after that night at the top of the tower is for nothing. The tower, more than anything, taught him what it really is to carry a burden. To be haunted. To renounce the mistakes of the past will pull the knife out of the wound, but the corruption merely spreads under the healed skin. The pain is so great. I can see it in him every time he comes to this goddamned place. But without the burden, the journey becomes pointless. A question to rip a man's soul from his body.

If Aurelio makes the same decision again, he undersigns their decision to call us back to their hell. We had an advance screening of the performance that ended the world yesterday. Knowing what we all do now, does he choose to witness again? To call others to it? He can stand by the certainty which has led him to where he is today, but the ground on which he stands is falling away by the second. The possibility of his curiosity being akin to complicity with the atrocity being visited upon everyone is one that threatens to crush him.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" This question, posed by the tower, is forcing a clarification of his situation. Utter annihilation, or unforgivable collaboration.

I watched their performance in awe on that night. Visions more powerful than anything we had ever gotten with the herbs that we went so deep into the jungle hell to retrieve. A society of indescribable beauty. The inescapable damnation of the Planet of Hands. The eviscerated, nightmare love with which they regarded us. An experience speaking to the deepest levels of human expression, unspeakably alien to anyone with a speck of humanity left. It's no wonder they've tried to drive that from all of us.

I was the first to be called. To them, it was a reward, for finding them first. Come back home, the spectral man told me, eyes beaming with tears of twisted happiness. It seemed the only option, really. The only sane thing to do when faced with such magnificent beauty was to surrender. I could see it in all of us, transfixed. I saw it in me too. What they saw in me was a way to eliminate the last threads of resistance holding us all back. And behind that part of me open to the beauty of the world and its fine systems was something else. Something older, and wiser. Something that walked hand in hand with the darkest fears that we hold. Something red.

Through tears of ecstasy and joy, my hand found the long knife hanging from my belt. And in one fluid motion, passed down to me through what is dismissively referred to as the reptilian portion of my brain, I opened my own throat. Deep enough that my hands were not enough to stanch the curtain of blood pouring out of me. Blood enough to wash away even the visions crafted by this post-human non-humans. I fell to the floor, weakening instant by instant, my breath stolen by the impossibly gaping wound I had made. The cold of the room passed directly into me. Then the freezing cold of the night outside.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" By the time Aurelio got to me I was filled with the blasting chill of the black spaces between the stars.

Here are the last moments I saw in this life. Half of the Barqueros running like hell back to the door. Half of the Barqueros weeping with joy as their hands piled up in front of them, one after the other. Aurelio holding his coat to the ruin of my throat, praying aloud to the only saint he recognized, as though this were not something guided by her hand as well. The cold being followed closely by its brother darkness.

And then no more.

The sight of Aurelio faced with this choice makes me replay these moments in a way I have not done since they happened. And I would sooner cut my own throat a thousand more times than have him assaulted with this hideous suffering once more. I would do it ten thousand times more to be able to help him. I don't know what to do.

Aurelio turns away from the past arrayed before us and toward the gloating, icy face of the future. His hand is in his pocket.

You should have tried this in America somewhere, he says. Or some other place where they think they have this shit figured out.

He's been replaying the last time we were here too. I see it now. His hand is moving around whatever is in his pocket.

She replies. That you don't make the choice doesn't make it cease to exist, Aurelio Rojas. A dynamic state in the system is still well within its bounds. We accounted for your truculence, in any event.

Aurelio's hand moves slowly out of his pocket. From the way his arm is trembling I can tell that the movement is involuntary. There is nothing in his hand. A second later, a small metal box with a steel switch floats out of his pocket of its own accord. Aloft on a stillborn wind, it drifts away from Aurelio, stopping in front of the woman. She sneers, finally finding something worth her contempt amongst her cattle. She even goes so far as to raise her hand up.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Closing it into a fist, the detonator is crushed into a tiny, jagged point of metal. It clatters onto the ground.

Who is more God, Aurelio Rojas? The cow, squeezing out more life into its putrid field, unreasoning, vacant? Or the overseer, tending to the survival of that cow, adjusting the conditions in which it waits to serve its purpose, mending its organs and its flesh when the purpose requires it?

The hatred is not warming her voice. Is this what we are, truly, when the mask is off?

She continues. Surely even you were not so stupid as to think that we did not notice your kind attaching the explosives. You must have known that your actions are clearly laid out before you even made the decision to pursue them. Meaningless, empty gestures. Ill-considered. Petty. Much in keeping with your forebears, long ago.

The woman in the purple robes raises her other hand. Aurelio rises slowly into the air, held in place by the forces governing this skyward monument to futility that we had been so eager to discover. She spreads her arms, and thus are Aurelio's spread open as well now, a hovering Christ mockery. But his face. A beaming calm has overtaken him, a face at home on this impossible cross. The mockery is instead homage, somehow. The subtlety is lost on the mistress of the tower, the symbolism of the livestock beneath the contempt of the master. Here are where the final moves of his game are beginning to come to me.

His turn to speak now. So much effort, he says. To thwart a meaningless gesture. What does it say, oh great Monashir, that you are in this tower with us?

Cracks begin to appear in the ice cliffs of her face. This is angering her. Before she can reply he continues.

They must have been surprised, eh? To find something of themselves in here? Why hide this place, why let us hide afterward, if this is such an enduring symbol of your fucked up paradise? And why do you protect it by meeting me here?

He laughs now, and she loses control.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" With sudden violence, she lowers her hands, and Aurelio is thrown to the floor, slammed into the dust and debris beneath him. He lands on his side, bones cracking from the force, the breath driven from him by the impact. He coughs as he struggles to breathe again, heaped on the floor, blood beginning to drip from his lips. He laughs again.

Still trying to figure it out. The shit you're playing with didn't start with you, did it?

His words struggle out through his laughter and blood, no less clear from the effort as his life begins to leak out.

No, you've been right here with us, trying to figure out how you ended up on the top floor. Why the laws that govern this tower apply to you too. What the flaw in your system is that buried you along with all the other corpses. Scratching and clawing at your coffin lid.

The purple woman flickers and appears over him as he lies on the ground. Guttural fury leaking from her crumbled face, the hate now fully formed in her, dead eyes lit with pyres of rage. Her arms sweeps out, and Aurelio is thrown in the air away from her, striking the dais at the front of the room, wood splintering, his laughter making room for the groans of pain, unstoppable now.

He wheezes now as I rush to him, dead or not. I'll save you some trouble, he says. You thought you banished death. But all you did was forget about her. You thought you enslaved madness. But you merely brought him into your house. And you think saving this tower from us will let you solve the one problem you can't figure out. But I've got the answer for you. You belong in here with us. And you'll never know why. You can't understand.

She's over him again. I look up at her from my place next to Aurelio. She is going to end it.

He spits blood up at her with ragged breaths. As she moves to finish him, he returns the favor.

You forsake death, and death's wisdom is lost to you. You push madness away into this world, but it lives in my heart instead, and you are defenseless.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" You've blinded yourselves, but the grave awaits you all anyway. Fuck your mother.

Horrifying, terrible force comes down from above her, now channeling the fury that has driven her beyond all reason, striking moments too late before Aurelio has laid bare the chasm at the heart of the perfect world that now must reckon with its hidden cracks. Hatred wells out of the fault lines in her self and her realm, spewing out like a geyser. No pushing it back in now.

She strikes Aurelio with her fists, crushing his chest, silencing him. I scream with no words or breath, such things forever beyond me here. Something catches my eye through the ruins of his shirt.

A freshly sutured wound on his sternum. The glint of exposed metal. The last halting breaths, a smile still plastered on his bloody lips. I feel him looking toward me through darkening eyes. From deep within him I swear I hear something.

She hears it too. The terror of something impending, building within her at Aurelio's words, now seizes her. The madness lives in his heart. It lives in all of our hearts, decaying every system they touch, even from our living tomb in the stars. They will never outrun it because we are they and they are us.

Dead man switch. Wired in his chest. His heart stops beating. She has just enough time to bellow like a cow in the slaughterhouse chute.

Here is the last moment. Deep rumbling. The walls and the ceiling and the floor buckling. Fire. Smoke. Gouts of dust and bits of metal and plaster and stone rushing all around us. Aurelio borne aloft on a great pillar of flame as the great tomb at the heart of the world's necropolis comes apart, the winds and the sunlight and the wreckage all suddenly of one composition. The purple woman burning for a second before being rent asunder by the uncertainty and death that lay at the heart of humanity. A mortal wound that will be felt a million miles away, perhaps in a million years. Perhaps tomorrow.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" A funeral pyre that will burn away the dead and make room for the living. Even if the dead do not acknowledge it yet. I feel myself rising with Aurelio. What does it matter when the truth lay outside of time? There is us. There is madness. There is death. In these things we proceed in all directions, blasted apart by the first and last forces, and settling back again. This monument to colossal, unimaginable error has stopped existing. Eventually, one of these directions must take us to something closer to the truth. Closer to balance. Death shows her face once more and guides us to mercy again. She shows her face to me at long last.

I am with him in the end, in the sky of a world giving way to whatever the next may be.

I know no more.

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Euclid

Clearance Designation: Level 5

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 cannot be secured or contained conventionally, and it is unknown if it may occur in the future. As such, a reactive approach is to be adopted. Said approach consists of the following Chapters of the Forbidden City Convention:

Prevention and minimisation of the conditions conductive to the possible occurrence of SCP-001 or its equivalent via Forbidden City Convention Chapter I.
Management of organisational transition and unity following implementation of Forbidden City Convention Chapter I, via Forbidden City Convention Chapters II and III respectively.
All above mentioned Chapters of the Forbidden City Convention are not to be altered, unless via a unanimous vote by the O5 Council.

Description: SCP-001 is a successful occurrence of a CK-class restructuring scenario, which generated the current reality via alteration of a previous iteration of reality. Based on first-person accounts, SCP-001 occurred on the 1st of June in the year 1900 Anno Domini of the previous reality. The nature of SCP-001 is such that all causes, events, references and memories of Occult War i (referred to as the 'Fifth Occult War' in the previous reality) are omitted and replaced with various anomalous and non-anomalous parallels in the current reality.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Foundation documentation regarding Occult War i is obtained from anecdotal accounts of thirteen non-anomalous human beings who retain their memories of the previous reality via a phenomenon coined as 'partial SCP-001 immunity'. However, the mechanism behind partial SCP-001 immunity is unknown and will not be assessed, as decided by the O5 Council. Efforts to identify additional individuals (if any) with partial SCP-001 immunity are on indefinite hiatus, as decided by the O5 Council.

Below is an abridged list of events during Occult War i and plausible analogous events in the current reality; see Document OWi for an expanded list.

Accessing Document OWi

The following is a compilation of executive summaries of various anomalous incidents that has occurred during Occult War i and plausible analogous events in the current reality. Executive summaries have been compiled by the first iteration of the O5 Council via the following format:

Phenomenon:

Description:

Analogue in Current Reality:

A summary description of Occult War i is as follows:

A global war occurring throughout the 19th century Anno Domini, coalesced from three separate conflicts in Europe (Napoleonic War), East Asia (Daevite conquest) and North America (American Civil War). It is also notable for overt use of anomalous objects, leading to an IK-class Global Civilisation Collapse scenario.

For more information on Occult War i and its consequences, see [REDACTED].

## Europe and Russia

Phenomenon: UnLondon Proposal

Description: An evacuation plan was presented to the British Parliament by Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal, whereby the populace of London shall be evacuated to an underground shelter in light of potential French invasion of the British Isles. Proposal was rejected due to its impracticality and relative ease of alternative evacuation to Ireland and other dominions.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Analogue in Current Reality: UnLondon Proposal was not presented to the British Parliament. However, the term 'UnLondon' is used as a referent for SCP-1678.

Phenomenon: Uralic Front

Description: A series of battles in the Ural Mountains between the French-led Continental System and Daevite Empire. Russia joined the Continental System during this period, primarily offering assistance via the House of Romanov's pact with a Grigori.

Analogue in Current Reality: Napoleonic France instead invaded Russia, to which SCP-2617-A instances were used to retaliate.

Phenomenon: Samothrace Anomaly

Description: [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO O5-1]

Analogue in Current Reality: See SCP-1173

Phenomenon: The Schriftsteller and Giftschreiber

Description: The Schriftsteller and Giftschreiber were thaumaturgic-memeticists working throught Europe, providing textual memetic effects to clients.

Analogue in Current Reality: The Schriftsteller were killed in the Battle of Herbsthausen on the orders of General Franz Freiherr von Mercy with the exception of PoI-382 (Thilo Zwist). See SCP-5382, SCP-5734 and SCP-5054-EX for related anomalies. The status of the Giftschreiber is currently unknown but presumed to be active.

## North Africa and the Middle East

Phenomenon: Phélippeaux's Crisis

Description: An eruption originated from a crater in French Levant, spawning numerous entities which later attacked locals and occupying French forces. Some entities were captured by the French for undetermined purposes.

Analogue in Current Reality: Did not occur. Instead, French Col. Picard de Phélippeaux augmented containment of SCP-1844 as per Napoleon's orders.

Phenomenon: Evacuation of Tehran

Description: Amidst a surprise Daevite assault into Tehran, 90% of the city's populace evacuated the city. Shah Naser al-Din was able to escape with the aid of golems summoned by the city's rabbinic community and an ancestral takwin.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Analogue in Current Reality: The aforementioned takwin is believed to be SCP-2067, in which Shah Naser al-Din is believed to be aware of. No known evacuation of Tehran's populace has been noted thus far.

Phenomenon: Invasion of Yajuj and Majuj

Description: Following a failed invasion of the Ottoman Empire, retreating Daevite forces intentionally destroyed the Iron Wall of Dhul-Qarnayn, triggering an invasion of the Middle East by the forces of 'Yajuj and Majuj.' After suffering heavy losses, the Ottoman army repelled the invaders and rebuilt the Iron Wall of Dhul-Qarnayn with the assistance of Neo-Gnostic engineers from the Kingdom of Ionia, a French client state.

Analogue in Current Reality: The Iron Wall of Dhul-Qarnayn is contained as SCP-2309, and no known breach has ever taken place.

## North America

Phenomenon: Strannik's Testimony

Description: A testimony obtained from Vladimir Strannik, a white human with the ability to travel to different points in history while asleep (designated as Phenomenon 2896-012 by the American Secure Containment Initiative [ASCI]). Strannik claims that the general populace have no recollection of Occult War i in the 20th century and beyond.

Analogue in Current Reality: Strannik is contained as SCP-2896. The claim of no recollection among the general populace is believed to be due to a CK-class restructuring event.

Phenomenon: Navajo Nation

Description: A Navajo nation-state formed following Cem Anáhuac's invasion of Texas. Members of the Navajo Nation possess the anomalous ability to alter its appearance into that of various animal species, which is believed to have contributed to the Navajo's resistance against Cem Anáhuac. As such, ASCI has rounded up significant portions of the Navajo population for experimentation to identify measures against mental malady created by Cem Anáhuac.

Analogue in Current Reality: Semi-autonomous Native American territory formed after the Treaty of 1868.""")

Phenomenon: Gerald's General Goods

Description: A small but formidable group formed after the complete disbanding of Marry, Catherine, and Duke's trade goods. The group was designed to create anomalies and to supply them to people for a price. Gerald Nakelo, the leader of the group, was reported to have created a book that, once weekly, would inform him of a way to create an anomaly, and how to control it after creation.

Analogue in Current Reality: Group was disbanded shortly after being founded, but did create a failed prototype of the book before disbanding, which has since been heavily altered by another entity.

Phenomenon: Civil Rights Act of 1866

Description: A bill signed into law by the U.S. Congress. Anomalous elements in the bill's text caused 3.2 million human beings with non-standard anatomical features to manifest in cities controlled by the Union. A majority of the humanoids were forcibly drafted into the Union Army after initial containment efforts by the ASCI were met with failure.

Analogue in Current Reality: The bill was vetoed by President Johnson and a non-anomalous revision was introduced to the U.S. Senate by embedded ASCI agents. Copies of the original bill are currently in storage, though it is believed that other copies currently exist outside containment.

Phenomenon: Bigfoot

Description: Reports of ape like creatures that stand upright are noted within the northwest region of North America. ASCI agents were sent to investigate these claims, and communication was lost. After approximately 3 months, the agents returned claiming that they have made a treaty with them, allowing them to use their anomalous biotechnology in exchange for aid whenever the creatures would need them.

Analogue in Current Reality: The apes went uncontacted from humans for thousands of years after an event known as the Day of Flowers.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Instances have been spotted off and on throughout human history, and only recently have the creatures been designated as SCP-1000.

## East Asia

Phenomenon: Southern Qing Dynasty

Description: A rump state established by Qing loyalists who have fled to Taiwan island following the Daevite conquest of East Asia. Despite limited naval capabilities, the Southern Qing were able to establish settlements on various islands across the Pacific Ocean via unknown means.

Analogue in Current Reality: Paralleled to the Kuomintang's exile to Taiwan following the Chinese Civil War. Additionally, SCP-2880 is speculated to be the means in which the Southern Qing used to settle on other islands.

Phenomenon: Later Qin Dynasty

Description: A Chinese state located in central China, founded after the Daevite's occupation of Shaanxi Province, China. Despite being surrounded by Daevite-occupied territories, the Later Qin has maintained independence. Rumours alleged that it is ruled by a figure named 'Qin Shi Huang'; it is unknown if it is indeed Qin Shi Huang (first emperor of the Qin Dynasty) or a person using the name 'Qin Shi Huang'.

Analogue in Current Reality: No such polity is known to exist. SCP-2101 is to be monitored at all times and the Foundation is to offer support to SCP-2101-1 instances in the containment of the former.

Phenomenon: Legend of Silent Wind

Description: A folk legend originated from contemporary Jiangsu Province, China. It revolves around an eponymous martial artist who died protecting a village from a Daevite regiment. The corpse of 'Silent Wind' was never found.

Analogue in Current Reality: 'Silent Wind' is one of the personas utilised by SCP-2788. However, it has no recollection of fighting against the Daevites.

## Non-combatant Regions

Phenomenon: Quechuan Insurgency

Description: Second-hand reports of sapient alpacas inciting rebellions in the Viceroyalty of Peru. Said inciters advocated for Inca religion to serve as state religion.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Outcome of insurgency is unknown.

Analogue in Current Reality: Peru declared independence from Spain in the 19th century. As there is no attempt to enforce Inca religion as state religion, involvement of SCP-1253 is believed to be minimal or insignificant.

Phenomenon: Messer's Fourth Law of Anomalous Phenomena

Description: Colt Messer, a physicist that originated the area known as "The Secluded Garden", set forth a law regarding anomalous phenomena. For every anomalous phenomenon, there is a non-anomalous phenomenon to balance it out within the universe. Whenever a phenomenon is fully explained to be non-anomalous, another anomaly will manifest in the universe to balance it out. This law applies to all fields of science where anomalies occur.

Analogue in Current Reality: After the occurrence of SCP-001, an anomaly was explained by the SCP Foundation, yet no other anomaly was discovered using [REDACTED] Universal Reality Detecter (SAHURC), breaking Messer's Fourth Law of Anomalous Phenomena. However, as the failure of Messer's Fourth Law of Anomalous Phenomena is considered an anomaly, the law was never broken as an anomaly did manifest in the form of the failure of Messer's Fourth Law. [REDACTED] The following paradox manifested as SCP-033 (Mathematics), SCP-2821 (Physics), SCP-2046 (Chemistry), and SCP-1877 (Biology), correlating with the main branches of scientific study where anomalies normally manifest.

END OF DOCUMENT OWi

The cause and origin of SCP-001 are unknown and cannot be ascertained. It is unknown if SCP-001 or its equivalent have occurred prior to its known occurrence or may ever occur in the future. Additionally, it is unknown if SCP-001 represents a typical or atypical occurrence of a CK-class restructuring scenario.""")

In their place, a unitary organisation is to be established.

The mission of this unitary organisation is to secure and contain various anomalous objects in order to protect Mankind from said objects.

The referent for this unitary organisation is agreed to be the 'Foundation'; the following alternative referents (i.e. 'Institute', 'Organisation', 'Organization' and 'Front') have been proposed and rejected.

The aforementioned thirteen organisations in which the Foundation is formed from are henceforth designated as 'Foundation precursor'.""")

CHAPTER II: THE O5 COUNCIL

The provisional executive administration of the Foundation is to consist of an executive council composed of thirteen individuals from each of Foundation precursor.

The aforementioned thirteen individuals of this executive council were selected due to the following criteria:

Leadership position in respective Foundation precursor.
Possession of memory regarding Occult War i.
Future members of this executive council are not required to possess both of the above mentioned qualities.

The referent for this executive council is agreed to be the 'O5 Council'; the following alternative referents (i.e. 'Overseers Committee', 'Level 5 Council' and 'O5 Command') have been proposed and rejected.

The function of the O5 Council is to facilitate initial transition from Foundation precursors.

Each O5 Council member is designated with a Roman numeral ranging from One to Thirteen.

Other organisations merged into the Foundation henceforth are to be denied representation on the O5 Council.

CHAPTER III: GROUPS OF INTEREST

Organisations with awareness of anomalous phenomena that are not subsumed under Foundation control are hereby designated as 'Groups of Interest'.

The Foundation's default approach towards Groups of Interest is to pursue for their dissolution, termination and/or assimilation of their personnel and resources.

Welcome O5-1

To my successor,

As the main editor of SCP-001, I have already written all that you need to know. After SCP-001, only the thirteen of us knew of it and we each stood at the height of our respective precursor organisations. Certainly, we were fated to take command and unite as the Foundation.

As you can tell from the votes, there were two other alternatives for SCP-001 from our debate at Peking.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" They were ultimately voted down, but Two and Twelve left their marks on Foundation history. A pity that Twelve's limited command of the English language mustered a relatively vernacular term, as opposed to Two's and mine. Nevertheless, our initiative to speak up for the first O5 meeting will be remembered and honoured in almost every SCP article ever penned down.

As for the Foundation's mission, I hope you and your colleagues continue our work.

Welcome O5-2

To my successor,

Santayana once said, "those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it". Now, the world as a whole cannot remember the past. But does it repeat itself? Yes it does.

During the Second World War, was there not another authoritarian dictator terrorising Europe and were the Chinese not massacred again? Of course, the details differ and America kept itself together throughout that war. Maybe that civil war occurred again in your lifetime, or will occur soon. Or that scaled down skirmish was it. That still leaves the Factory, but it is illusive.

The product of an anomaly should be an anomaly in itself; SCP-001 and this world are no exceptions. Piece by piece, this world is undoing and repeating itself. For every SCP not (if not, minimally) in our control, the process is ongoing. Until then, there will be chaos in the system. Once, I proposed that we guide the world back to its original state but the others disagreed in favour of establishing tyranny. Ultimately, I acceded. There is no need to fight for my views. Nothing will change the process.

No action is needed, except to wait. Or in short, 'Keter'.

Welcome O5-3

To my successor,

Anomaly and normalcy — both are subject to the consensus. Today's anomaly might have been yesterday's normality, and vice versa. The scandal Nine uncovered is one such example; drapetomania is no longer anomalous when the consensus decides it no longer holds water.

Apply the consensus onto SCP-001.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" To the rest of the world, the Occult Wars do not exist. They exist only to those who know the anomalous. To those who know the anomalous, Occult War i does not exist. Only thirteen men imagined it to have existed, and that could have been SCP-001.

However, the council established our own consensus and my opinion shifted to that when it was announced. More of us decided that we should establish order over all anomalous matters instead of suggesting that we might be the problem. That would only be the first of the many consensuses reached, where we held influence over the world's conceptions of what is normal and what's not. Perhaps they resulted in the world you have grown up in.

Thus, remember these. Consensus has value, and to be normal is to abide by the consensus.

Welcome O5-4

To my successor,

I'm one of the few who have fought in the front lines for both Fifth Occult Wars. I was gravely disappointed by the official Fifth Occult War, which is more accurately a skirmish. Those Boxers simply can't compare to the Daevites and clockwork worshippers. Even after turning almost every other agency and cult into our enemies, the wainscot society cannot compare to total war.

Perhaps it's the youthful bloodlust in me talking. It's a frequent quirk since SCP-001 happened, like during Peking when I voted for Two's proposal out of impulse. I didn't care for his strange theory. I only wanted to fight on. So many sacrifices were made already, and I have made significant sacrifices as well. They cannot end in quiet days.

But now, I'm old and quietness will come for me. But you are here to fight on. Make sure that it does not end in quietness.

Welcome O5-5

To my successor,

You now know that the world was once averted from total destruction due to an uncontrolled event. And because it is uncontrolled, we cannot guarantee if it can work again. Or if it would be in our favour. We should not rely on uncertainties like SCP-001.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

As a species, we have mastered and stomped on all the beasts and lands of the world respectively. Many crafts are now mastered by Man, crafts that were once dreams. The restoration of the world is simply another thing to be mastered. If the world can rewind itself, we can do it too.

By combining our resources, the magnum opus I envisioned can be reality. It might have been utilised already or construction is still ongoing, but SCP-001 will be irrelevant when it's ready. By our will, Mankind rules eternal.

Welcome O5-6

To my successor,

We agreed that SCP-001 happened, but we don't know if it is the only time SCP-001 ever happened. Could it happen again? Must the world be near its annihilation for it to work? How much is it enough? What about trans-reality memory retention, a more accurate term than that ill-defined compromise? How does it work? Why only us? Can it be replicated? The list goes on.

This unusual phenomenon's level of uncertainty surely necessitates quantification. 'Euclid' is a reminder of that conviction, that more should be known about SCP-001. I suppose you would have that drive, cultivated by the Foundation's advocacy for scientific methodology. Containing and protecting cannot be the ends; knowledge is. But the majority of the first council was too afraid to probe and wanted to either abandon it or be preventive. Neither solves the problem, really.

But you can do your part in solving it. Only you can see this and have access to however little I can find out, so let that be your starting point. May you deliver results and bring meaningful data to SCP-001.

Welcome O5-7

To my successor,

Officially, only thirteen people were immune to SCP-001. But there is another, Jibril Mani. He was a consultant working for the Sublime Porte, and we met when I took refuge in Constantinople due to Napoleon. He was most hospitable and we became fast friends despite the traditional enmity between Christendom and Dar al-Islam.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" We stayed with each other until the occurrence of SCP-001, where I find myself in Rome.

In the current world, he managed to contact me and I knew he remembered our friendship in the lost past. Meeting him, we spoke extensively about our memories of Occult War i. I invited him to join me in an upcoming gathering in Peking with other men who remembered the war, but he politely declined.

Jibril would rather defend his friends and clansmen, especially when we knew that the Middle East was in chaos then. He was sceptical towards One and his affiliation, but I could not blame his suspicion and respected his wishes. We parted ways since then. While I took on the title of O5-7, Jibril told me that he would return to Iran to gather allies for his cause.

Just as he desired to protect his loved ones, my obligation is to the world and I will defend it.

P.S. Out of respect, I decided not to report to the Council about Jibril. I do hope that whatever organisations Jibril and the council built in the end will not clash. We only wish to protect.

Welcome O5-8

To my successor,

As you can infer from the votes, there were three choices that ultimately led to SCP-001. One's proposal was really the only option. The others were stupid. Two essentially demanded us to be anarchists, while Twelve assumed that we're a bunch of lunatics who need an Oriental drug. No thank you to either!

Most of us have been collecting anomalous objects to begin with, so the Foundation is not much different from at least half of its precursors. As for the other half, the Groups of Interest will have everyone on the same page.

You should have been doing this job for quite some time, so I expect you to keep it up.

Welcome O5-9

To my successor,

SCP-001 is the restructuring of reality, that's our consensus. Therefore, SCP-001 is reality bending. Two claimed that reality will inevitably revert to correct the world, which is similar to Scranton's famous address on the topic.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" That being said, the latter insisted that reversion would be caused by the reality bender. It might be hard to control sapient beings, although some scholars believe that an engine may theoretically increase the probability. This prospect brings hope — that the greatest known act of reality bending can be reverted.

And when it happens, the world might revert to its previous state — complete with my home in the African Free State, where the IK-class scenario did not really apply. It might as well be the previous world's only safe haven. That stability was lost after SCP-001, and I ended up working in a less hospitable setting.

Even though I was not favourable to One's concept, the Foundation is by far a better environment. It is also a good place to figure out how to realise Scranton's ideas, or at least invest in someone who can. Despite the money and subjects I have supplied, progress has been slow and I have come to terms that I might never regain my losses.

But you can, should SCP-001 happen again. You should continue the research in whatever way you can, because you shouldn't be like me and lose that which is yours. No one deserves that.

Welcome O5-10

To my successor,

There were thirteen groups that started the Foundation, but not all of us stand equal. Take Twelve's Abnormality Institute, unendorsed by the Qing. But mine is similarly in decline. Our namesake was a witch hunter, but none of us actually met a real witch. An interest group was a more accurate description for the Borja Knights of the late 19th century. If not for the memories I had of Occult War i, it would've remained that way.

When One spoke of his great scheme, I have my doubts about fighting the anomalous. Each new generation of knights is a shadow of the previous, and it shows. In Occult War i, I remembered my knights being annihilated by Napoleon's clockwork soldiers. They were (and are) not ready for an occult war or any fight against demons or sorcerers.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" To submit to One's proposal would have meant gruesome deaths for them again. As their grand master, I would not send them to their deaths.

When the vote was not in my favour, I briefly considered to not oblige to the terms of merger. That thought perished when I heard Eight's proposal to foster the unity of our newly-dubbed Foundation. After that, I decided that my knights should at least die meaningfully against monsters rather than as a sacrifice.

All of us die eventually. Make it meaningful for those you hold responsibility over.

P.S. All things considered, the resources from the other precursors did ensure that the last generation of knights will be better than the previous batch.

Welcome O5-11

To my successor,

Congratulations for your service to the Foundation. I imagine that you have to climb the hierarchy to reach this position, unlike I who was granted this position by virtue of being the first. Your virtue must be astounding, unlike mine.

During Occult War i, Kyoto fell to the Daevites. Emperor Kōmei and most of the council were killed. The Shogun and his agents only fled to Ezo. I was among the few to have left Kyoto alive, but only because I feared for my life. I ultimately regretted my choices, and shame overtook me. Not even death liberated me. At least Emperor Kōmei passed away in a less violent manner in this new world.

This brought me to my vote at Peking, that we were hallucinating and the amnestics will cure us. Actually, I only want to forget. But the consensus was reached, and I am not allowed to forget. One insisted that we were fated to work together, and no one else shall stand alongside us in this council.

At least it was tolerable, knowing that there were others like me. Three, Seven and Thirteen were very positive influences. My successor, I know not your colleagues in the O5 Council of your time, but they shall be your sworn allies. Remember that.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Welcome O5-12

To my successor,

I am sure you have heard of amnestics, and I am sure that it has been improved over the years. But the origins of amnestics (as a whole) is one of the many secrets of the Foundation. I will explain it.

Amnestics was originally a secret of the Meng Clan of alchemists. I married one of the clan's women to claim the right to make it. Originally, I wanted to cure myself of a series of disturbing visions which we now recognise as memories of Occult War i.

Before I could prepare the concoction for myself, Eleven contacted me and told me of similar visions. Soon, I gained knowledge that there are more men who experienced the same vision and they intend to meet at the capital. As a physician, it is my duty to see to everyone's recovery and I attempted to convince them that it will be safe if we take no unnecessary action. Most of them disagreed with my views, so they insisted on a democratic vote as per the ways of the West. Needless to say, my views were rejected.

But not amnestics. Five concluded that it is useful for it can revert memory, vaguely similar to SCP-001. Thus, amnestics stopped being a cure for the illness I had proposed, but to cure the common folk of any knowledge of the abnormal.

Unfortunately, Matriarch Meng did not approve of the foreigners' theft of her clan's secrets and the Meng Clan was one of the earliest Groups of Interest we faced. Their fate were as the Boxers were, although a junior or two might have escaped to Hong Kong with what little they knew of the formula.

Please be of use to the council. But if you have earned this position, you should be of use.

Welcome O5-13

To my successor,

SCP-001 said that only the thirteen leaders of the precursors were immune from its effects, but that was incorrect. There were only twelve.

One and I have known each other for decades, and I owed him a lot. Naturally, when he asked for a tiebreaker vote, I obliged.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He filled me in on the Daevite incursion in India to complete the deceit. When there were things I did not know of, I'd blame it on the British's unwillingness to be open with my regiment.

I suppose you might be ashamed of the title by now, but if not for me, I daresay we might have three different Foundations at war with one another. For me, it was an opportunity to be treated more seriously by the Europeans and I took advantage of it. Since then, I have made many amends so that others will not end up in my situation.

Thus, promise me that you vote according to your will, not by another's.

You don't need the keycard. The door is ajar.

It smells here. It smells like them. Hopefully, they've moved on. You've come so far already. You can't turn back now.

There is a slick trail that leads from the cave entrance and into the depths of the site. If it's blood or shit - or something that smeared off one of those things, you cannot tell. You make a point to avoid it.

You're still receiving the distress signal. It only started broadcasting yesterday. Whoever it is - you pray they're still alive.

Your footsteps echo throughout empty corridors. Each footfall sounds for all the world like a dozen, as if you're not treading through the dark alone.

If you're lucky.

The trail takes you to an office branching off the main hall - the source of the signal. The door is cracked open, but stuck. You plant your feet, push with all your might.

Something skitters out of one of the rooms to your left and around the corner before you can get a good look at it. Your first thought is 'dog'.

It was on the ceiling, though.

You take refuge in the room, slam the door behind you. It's dark here. You're safe. You take off your jacket and head wrap. It'd be a damn shame to die from something like hyperthermia after all that's happened.

The sole operating emergency light rotates in its casing - casting a pale orange glow across the room every other second.

As if the room itself had a pulse.

There's shelving haphazardly placed behind the door - a barricade. You scan the room. Soiled clothes, half eaten food.

Special Containment Procedures: Due to its nature, SCP-001 cannot be contained. Survivors of the SCP-001 event stationed within secure facilities are to remain in contact with one another. Personnel are encouraged to attempt to reach Site-51 Site-19 by any means at their disposal.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Personnel with knowledge as to the whereabouts of the O5 Council are to relay this information to the Administrator.

Survivors attempting to travel outdoors must fully cover their bodies in protective clothing; preferably several layers. Travel by foot should be limited as much as possible. Cities - and man-made structures in general - provide the greatest protection. Formerly-wooded areas should be circumvented. Travel by air is preferable above all other methods.

Personnel exposed to SCP-001 are to be considered lost. Compromised personnel are to be abandoned. Euthanization is not to be attempted.

Collective instances of SCP-001-A that are of formidable size are to be avoided at all costs. Conductive electrical weapons have proven partially effective at immobilizing instances, and may be used for self-defense. Incendiary weapons work as well. Cryonic munitions are the most effective thus far.

Testing has revealed that SCP-001-A is relatively safe to consume. This is only to be considered as a last resort in the absence of other options. As SCP-001-A may reconstitute within the digestive system, only small portions should be consumed at a time to prevent blockage.

Personnel stationed at Site-19 are to pursue research concerning off-world colonization. Shuttles must be constructed as to not allow light to penetrate the interior.

To those of you with families, or God forbid, children - I'm deeply, deeply sorry, you must push on. Do not let their deaths be in vain. We do still have time.

Humanity may still have a future. Come to Site-19. We need all the hands we can get.

Description: SCP-001 is the designation given to the Sun, after an event on [SYSTEM ERROR] Data lost: ec172. Contact SysAdmin. resulting in ~6.8 billion casualties within the first twenty-four hours. This event has been categorized as an XK-Δ-Class "Solar Singularity" Scenario.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

The SCP-001 effect does not seem to result from exposure to ultraviolet rays, but rather light in the visual spectrum (~390 to 700 nm). The effect is similarly present in moonlight.

Upon contact with visible light produced by the sun, living organisms liquefy at the point of contact, with the effect spreading until the entire organism is converted. Visually, this is reminiscent of melting wax. The time this takes is largely dependent on the level of exposure and size of the organism. Despite this restructuring, at no point do living organisms perish.

Upon completion, these organisms (SCP-001-A) take on a gelatinous consistency. Motile organisms will attempt to orient themselves in a fashion reminiscent of their previous form, to varying degrees of success.

Flora typically remain physically inert, yet are still capable of photosynthesis, and still produce oxygen. Organisms capable of flight lose the capability to do so. Fauna remain sentient, and display behavior that parallels their non-anomalous counterparts when not absorbed into a collective instance. Humans retain a modicum of sapience and memory.

Biological anomalies exposed to SCP-001 are affected in the same manner. It seems that exposure nullifies any previously expressed anomalous characteristics.

Due to their composition, instances of SCP-001-A that make contact with one another may combine and blend at the molecular level. This does not seem to cause any pain or distress to the instances, though the resulting bulk can inhibit movement. Since the SCP-001 event, most instances have congregated into such collectives, which seem to possess no maximum volume.

The resulting biomass is amorphous and chaotic. The component organisms will shift between a full-to-semi-liquid state - limbs and bodies will rise periodically from within the mass for a short duration, before deteriorating and being subsumed by another life-form.""")

Collective instances will locomote by using their appendages in tandem to carry their mass. Larger instances will form a pseudopod from their constituent life-forms, and drag themselves about in a manner similar to amoeba.

A brief moment of silence passes and then:

"Ahem. This is Doctor Logan Igotta, Level, um, Three researcher."
There's a quiver in her voice that betrays her attempts at professionalism. She pauses, takes a deep breath, and continues.

"Due to Site-46's possession of several communicable infohazards - we have, we have been cut off from the rest of the network u-under Blackout Protocol. As such, I'll be updating this as we come a-across new information.

She sighs.

"We... experienced a containment breach a few days ago. One of the higher-maintenance humanoids broke loose - son of a bitch compromised containment on half a, half a dozen Keters and ran off.

Anyways, since you were wondering, I'm fine. The guys are sitting around playing cards, I'm tucked in the corner with my notebook."
You can practically hear Igotta smiling as she jokes.

A moment of silence. Then, a match-strike followed by an audible exhale.

"And that's all of us. Everyone else was either top-side during the event, or they were killed in the breach. Director's orders are to stay put. Keep an eye on the cams - both in and around the facility. We've got the 001'd skips beating at our front door, and god knows what else locked in here with us.

She sits like this for an eternity, whispering apology after apology, begging forgiveness, lost in the moment. She looks up after some time.

Logan rummages beneath the desk for a moment, and produces a hand-held radio. Her hands are shaking. The thing implores her; its inhuman speech curdles your stomach.

Logan begins rocking back and forth in her chair.

"She won't stop. S-She won't go aw-away. I know I didn't, know I didn't pick up an info-fohazard browsing the archives. Tested my-myself for SCP-8673 infection. Negative. SCP-9189 is the, is the only other o-one that uses print as a vector. Can't b-be that, I still have all my fingers!"
Her lips crack into a broken grin. She lets out a weak laugh, and displays her trembling hands.

Two wedding bands loosely encircle the digit, laying atop one another.

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Yesod

Special Containment Procedures: Facility T, the headquarters location of the Foundation’s O5 Council and appurtenant management bodies, has been constructed around the location of SCP-001, including Building T-01 within the volume of SCP-001. The security protocols for Facility T are set forth in Document T-001:01.

Description: SCP-001 is an irregularly-shaped volume of space, approximately 65,000 cubic meters in volume inclusive of space both above and below the original ground level, located at ███████ in the Sinai. Apart from its thaumaturgic properties (described below), SCP-001 is unremarkable, and matter and energy can freely enter and leave it. Archaeological work performed by the French Commission des Sciences et des Arts in the late 18th century indicated the remains of a stone structure at the site dating to the late 2nd millennium BCE fitting the description of an inn. As a result of the construction of Facility T, no trace of the original structure remains.

SCP-001 is distinguished as the only known natural location on Earth with absolute zero ambient Akiva radiation. Experimentation has verified that this condition persists even when an emission source of Akiva radiation is brought near or within the spatial limits of SCP-001,(See Research Report SCP-001.08.P (Relic of Tooth of the Buddha), 1974.
) which indicates that not only does the outer boundary of SCP-001 impermeably block Akiva radiation from crossing it in either direction, SCP-001 absorbs and destroys any Akiva radiation that would otherwise be generated within its volume.

As a consequence of SCP-001’s properties, the natural progression of degeneration or termination of Homo sapiens cognitive function and organic functionality are suspended while the Homo sapiens subject in question remains within the limits of SCP-001. Put another way, subject to certain limitations, human death does not occur within SCP-001.""")

Test: 01.003

Parameters: Personnel D-2326, a healthy human female, is placed in an airtight vessel within SCP-001. A lethal dose of cyanide gas is released into the vessel. After completion of the test, the gas is vented.	

Outcome: No change. D-2326 suffered no adverse medical effects.

Test: 01.006	

Parameters: Same parameters as Test 01.003, but subjects are thirty healthy specimens of Rattus norvegicus.

Test: 01.009

Parameters: Personnel D-5337, a human female suffering from stage 4 cancer (metastasized to most organs) and with a prognosis of imminent death, is placed in a standard containment cell within SCP-001 and observed for 786 days.	

Outcome: No change, including any advance in cancer symptoms, while subject remained within SCP-001. Subject expired within 48 hours after being removed from SCP-001 after the conclusion of the test.

… In Matters of natural Philosophy and of understanding the Substance of the almighty God, we must begin our Investigation with the Evidence of our Senses, which includes the Testimony of holy Scripture. For no Man hath seen God, but the Perception of God may come from observing His Creation, and from the careful Study of holy Scripture.
Consider Exodus iv which, being rendered in the Hebrew:

ויהי בדרך במלון ויפגשהו יהוה ויבקש המיתו׃
ותקח צפרה צר ותכרת את־ערלת בנה ותגע לרגליו ותאמר כי חתן־דמים אתה לי׃

Which, being interpreted, sayeth:

And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him – meaning Moses – and sought to kill him. Then Zipporah – the wife of Moses – took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, "Surely a bloody husband art thou to me."(Exodus 4:24–26)

Consider the Teaching of these Verses. Many learned Scholars focus their Attention on the Second of these Verses, in which Zipporah, the wife of Moses, performs the Rite of Circumcision and, in so doing, saves her Husband from the wrath of the almighty God. Therein, say the Scholars, lies the moral Lesson that none, not even God's Prophet, shall be exempt from the Laws of His Covenant.

But consider the First of these Verses, which is so little Understood. The almighty God, having formed an Intent to kill Moses, attempted to do so and failed. This Episode is the Key to the understanding of the Substance of God. For we must understand that if Scripture is Infallible, and Scripture tells us that the almighty God tried to kill Moses but failed, then infallible Scripture sayeth that God is not omnipotent, or at least that God's Power does not extend to that particular Place.""")

Sir Isaac Newton, Observations upon the Substance of God (1724)

" … The newly-invented thaumometric apparatus permitted our Order to verify what we had long suspected, namely that the Divine Grace - or as some of our brethren are more apt to put it - the thaumaturgic force - was a phenomenon of actual, measurable substance. One of my colleagues proposed the name "akiva" as the unit of measurement for this phenomenon, after some long-dead Hebrew martyr. This philosophical and technological breakthrough prompted the initiation of several projects, including a comprehensive mapping of conditions and variations of akiva throughout the globe. This was not to be a mere frippery such as the charting of the source of the Nile or the naming of some inconsequential sea-rock- rather, the thaumographic map will be an invaluable tool in allowing our Order to harness the powers of the Divine Grace.
"And so, we organized cartographic teams, each equipped with a thaumometric apparatus, to commence the mapping project, with special concentration on regions of particular interest.

“In a particular corner of the Holy Land, Napoleon Bonaparte showed us the way. As you know, Napoleon’s campaign into Egypt in 1798 was accompanied by the Commission des Sciences et des Arts, which completed a comprehensive survey of that country.(Description de l'Égypte, ou Recueil des observations et des recherches qui ont été faites en Égypte pendant l'expédition de l'armée française) Volume eleven of that report charted the geographic locations of historic locations, including the biblical Mount Horeb. And so, fortified with this information, a team of Freemasons and members of our Hermetic Order, led by myself, traveled to the Sinai to retrace the steps of Moses from Mount Horeb back to the court of Pharaoh.

Bram Stoker, transcription minutes of meeting of Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (1874)

Excerpt of memorandum by Site Director William Wynn Westcott(Westcott co-founded an organization that is one of the Foundation’s predecessor entities.) to Helena Blavatsky, October 16, 1890
… Having studied the Inn, and testing its properties, only one conclusion can be reached. God has a blind spot, and we have found where it is.

The properties of the Inn present a number of thaumometric engineering opportunities beyond merely hiding from the Angel of Death. We now know that the ambient Akiva radiation level within the Inn remains at zero regardless of what happens inside. By implication, since this is God’s blind spot, there can be no theological consequence to an action taken within its boundaries. Although I am no physicist, our colleague Nikola has described it to me as being essentially a Faraday cage for sin. The suitability of such a location as the headquarters of the central decision-making body of our new Order should be obvious.

… As a result of our study of the properties of SCP-001, we are now ready to begin our first trials here at Site-36 for the artificial generation of a shielded Akiva vacuum, which we’re calling the antimonad. Essentially we're going to create another instance of SCP-001. Today’s test will be the culmination of over twenty years of advances in thaumometric engineering and applied theology. Bertrand, my assistant, puts it more bluntly: we’ve built a box and we’re pushing God out of it…

…

It turns out that just as nature abhors a vacuum, so does immanence. Our instrument readings indicate that when the antimonad came on line and the measurable Akiva rating within the test capsule dropped to zero, the Hume level spiked.""")

Gentlemen:
The frequency and severity of anomalous incidents appears to have dramatically increased since the 31 July incident at Site-36;(While no causal link to the antimonad test has been conclusively proven as of yet, the timing is noted.) As we have discussed, this episode underscores the need for the Foundation to revisit and expand its mission charter. To date we have been a research organization. But emergency times call for emergency measures, and it has become imperative for our organization to do more than contain the specimens that we study. We must take steps to secure those anomalies not already within the Foundation's custody, both in order to protect the anomalies for further research and to protect humanity as a whole.

To: The Administrator; O5 Council

From: Sheldon Katz, Esq.
Date: 3 August 19██

Re: Status of negotiations (Project Uriel)

I believe that we have reached an understanding with the counterparty. The purpose of this memorandum is to memorialize the principal points of understanding.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" As we have discussed, the formal agreement will be presented in the form of a covenant.(Stone tablets are expected, but I have asked for a .pdf file as well.)

BACKGROUND
The Foundation’s operations at Facility T have for some time been a sticky point vis-à-vis our relations with the counterparty. Recent developments, too voluminous to be summarized here, have prompted the Foundation’s senior management to seek a rapprochement with the counterparty, both to facilitate ongoing research and containment efforts, to avoid accelerating a theoeschatalogical catastrophe, and to maintain the efficacy of certain Foundation protocols such as the containment regimen for SCP-1844. At senior management’s direction, then, my office undertook negotiations with the counterparty. The points summarized below represent the outcome of these negotiations.

SUMMARY OF POINTS OF UNDERSTANDING
1. No natural person may physically remain within Facility T for a continuous period in excess of 120 years. This limit applies to members of the O5 Council, other members of the Foundation management and staff, test subjects, and others. The Foundation is expected to enforce this limitation.

2. Minutes of the proceedings of the Ethics Committee are to be communicated to the counterparty not less frequently than annually.(The precise logistics of this communication have not yet been worked out, but I suspect that it will consist of writing them on parchment and then burning them in a brazier located outside of Facility T.)

3. The counterparty shall not smite, strike down or otherwise exact wrath upon any of the Foundation personnel named on Exhibit A (as amended from time to time by the mutual agreement of the parties) without at least 90 days’ written notice and an opportunity to cure the transgression; provided, however, that this clause shall not be applicable in the case of a tribulation of general applicability.

4.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Neither the Foundation nor any of its executive-level personnel shall bow down to or worship any divine entity other than the counterparty; for I, the LORD am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.(The counterparty insisted upon this clause. Because the clause does not actually compel any action but merely forbids it, I applied my discretion to accept this point. I assume that the first-person draftsmanship will be cleaned up in the final version.)

5. The Foundation and the counterparty shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with respect to the containment of the adverse entities described on Exhibit B (collectively, the “Angra Mainyu”).(Dr. al-Taqi explained to me that the Office of Tactical Theology can use the help.)

Please contact me to discuss the points of understanding before the formal agreement is completed.

First, the SCP-001 slot is specifically reserved for use by the O5 Council as they deem necessary.

Second, "consensus reality" is simply consensus of the Council.

Item #: SCP-001
Object Class: Non-Anomalous

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is kept on a dedicated server or library located in a place of the O5 Council's choosing. The normal prohibition of O5 members from contacting SCP-designated objects does not apply in the case of SCP-001 as it is not anomalous.

Any additions, deletions, or updates to SCP-001 requires the consensus decision of the O5 Council. Access to SCP-001 is limited to the O5 Council. Access by other Foundation members or non-Foundation entities constitutes a containment breach that may result in a Broken Masquerade scenario. General amnestic release is authorized to be used in the case of a containment breach, up to and including global Class A amnesticization, as required.

Description: SCP-001 is the document describing consensus reality. Anomalous activity is therefore defined as any activity that occurs outside the parameters of the document. The document may describe certain characteristics of reality as inherently anomalous, as decided upon by the O5 Council.

General practice has included universal laws of gravitation, physical forces, and basic chemistry, biology, sociology, and philosophy. Presently, discoveries and technological development are not considered anomalous as long as they are built on a framework of knowledge previously designated consensus reality using the scientific method. All new claims of discovery are to be monitored for developments outside the parameters of SCP-001 which can be reproducible.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Claims of discovery that cannot be reproduced and appear to affect the perception of only the individual reporting the claim are not considered anomalous and can be allowed into the general public. In most cases these claims may result in the public calling them "hallucinations," "crackpot theories," or "conspiracies," and discounted. This is to be encouraged because it allows for plausible deniability when an anomaly is more widely witnessed in public.

All activities and objects outside the parameters of SCP-001 are to be tracked, secured, contained, removed from public knowledge, and protected by the SCP Foundation. Studies from such objects can be used in proposals for further updates to SCP-001.

The following excerpts have been cleared by the O5 Council as examples of update proposals to SCP-001. In all cases the speaker is not identified, nor are the logs complete.

Update Proposal: Declaration of modern witch-craft traditions arising in the United Kingdom as anomalous

Dialog:

Why are we even covering this? There are traditional beliefs in cultures throughout history that we do not consider anomalous. We must not use our position to threaten the right of humanity to believe.

Except this does not extend from traditional practices. This new "witch-craft" is a modern invention, developed through a scholarly rereading of practices as an alternative to Christianity. It is not a continuation, and practitioners are attempting spell-casting.

Soon you'll say Aleister Crowley has something to do with it. The document is clear: theurgy is anomalous, religion and spirituality are not. Show me proof that they are casting spells that cannot be explained under rigorous testing, and I will personally see to containing those spells myself. Until then, no, just as Thelema is allowed, so shall this witch-craft. For God's sake, we'll allow Satanism as long as they aren't channeling demonic energies.

Agreed.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Furthermore, we will need all the faith we can muster against the theurgic traditions. We never know when a new faith will assist in our cause.

Conclusion: No Update

Update Proposal: Re-evaluation of physics on the subject of nuclear fission

Dialog:

Thank you for responding to my emergency call. Trinity has happened. I can barely comprehend what I saw. It was like the sun rising from the desert sand, a dawn of destruction and fire that lasted for miles around. I cannot believe that such an explosion could ever be seen as possible. Tales and prior evidence of the summoning of gods have had less impact. I tremble with fear about the possibility of people wielding this kind of power, the ability to level a city with the flick of a switch.

Weren't the Germans and Russians also developing this technology? We are at war, and this sort of escalation happens.

May I remind my esteemed colleague that we are not at war? The United States, Japan, they are at war. We are not nations. No, the question stands: is this anomalous? Do the physical effects follow from the mathematical concepts?

They do follow. Scientific testing was completed each and every step of the way to reach this point. I do not believe this is anomalous, no matter how frightening the repercussions are.

What, you're just going to let people hold onto the keys to their own destruction? We have fought tooth and nail to keep such capabilities out of the reach of man, and you're now saying we should abandon our purpose?

We do not prevent destruction. We sequester the anomalous. And as long as we agree that the test was arrived at through diligent scientific process, available to anyone -

Available to anyone? Listen to yourself, man! Can you imagine a future where any two-bit dictator chooses to unleash the fire of a thousand suns wherever he wishes? Maybe the problem isn't with the equations. Maybe the whole of nuclear physics is anomalous itself.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Enrico Fermi has already received a Nobel Prize for his work on transuranic elements and radioactivity. We can't just secure nuclear physics from the world. Radioactivity is everywhere, and we end up causing more contradictions when we try to send ourselves back to the Dark Ages. Try explaining chemistry without referring to covalent bonds. Try explaining biology. Nuclear physics is here to stay, and we had better get used to the consequences of this, no matter how terrifying this will be for the planet and for humanity.

May God have mercy on our souls.

Conclusion: Recent developments in the studies and applications of nuclear fission and the results of their unleashing are added to SCP-001.

Update Proposal: Classification of "Worm-That-Walks" phenomenon

Dialog:

For those unfamiliar with the topic, the "worm that walks" is a trope in which a character is actually a writhing hive-mind of worms generally held together as a single mass. We are not here to discuss this trope. Instead, we are here to discuss the recent conspiracy that has arisen from it. The conspiracy is the idea that certain individuals are actually worms that walk, and not humans.

Does the conspiracy have any merit?

No. Individual conspiracy believers are divided themselves on who is a worm that walks and who isn't, and all evidence indicates that there aren't actual worms that walk in the general populace. It pretty clearly falls under irreproducible conspiracy theories. I believe there's nothing we need to do or change in SCP-001.

It might not be as irreproducible as we think.

Why do you say that?

On 12/11/2013, a believer in the conspiracy from Decatur, Alabama, killed his neighbor under the belief that the neighbor was a worm that walks. The killer then took a video of his deceased neighbor and uploaded it to YouTube, claiming it was proof of the conspiracy, and that the corpse was dissolving into individual worms before his very eyes.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He said that he was going to take a sample. The video was very quickly blocked and removed, and everyone who has viewed the video agrees that the subject is unmoving and does not dissolve into worms. The killer turned himself in to the police while clutching a jar of Tubifex worms and the neighbor sent to the Morgan County morgue. Autopsy confirmed that the decedent was missing a thumb postmortem and killed by gunshot to the chest - which, if he were a worm that walks, would be survivable.

So, this is just the actions of an insane man? No actual conspiracy?

The one item of interest was that after the autopsy, the assistant coroner oversaw the return of the body to the next of kin. The assistant coroner was also a conspiracy believer, and despite not having had any prior contact to the parties involved, screamed in disgust upon entering the examination room, grabbing a mop and complaining about all the worms everywhere. No one else noticed any signs of worm infestation.

Are we positive he didn't come across the video or anything?

We weren't sure. So, to test this, we acquired the corpse and showed it to a number of D-class. They all agreed that it was a human corpse. We then introduced them to the worm-that-walks conspiracy, and upon viewing the corpse again, 20% of them agreed that it was actually a mass of worms.

That sounds like a memetic hazard, then. Has the conspiracy literature been scanned by the CH Department?

CH found it negative for memetic effects, but did find a chart in one pamphlet that would function like a mnestic trigger, unlocking a memory. However, of course, it would only work if the affected had that memory.

And that memory would be?

Having recently seen a living worm that walks.

Conclusion: Language regarding mnestic triggers strengthened to include recent perception.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Although there remains no evidence that there is any truth to the worm-that-walks conspiracy, the repercussions of the existence of a mnestic trigger that works is something to think about. After all, have you heard about that thing dowwÐÁ“ŒÏMA3§

RESPONSE ACCEPTED ACCESSING SCP-001

Hello.

I'm afraid you won't find SCP-001 here. It's stored in a far more unreachable location than this. I'm sure you were hoping you could get in, edit it in a couple places here and there, and voilà, you're no longer anomalous, you're free to go, the Foundation will harass you no longer. Of course, it can't be that easy. But I am going to help you. You deserve this much.

I'm going to tell you why.

Why the Foundation targets you. Why we deem you something to contain, to persecute. After all, there are far worse evils in the world. We kept our record of nuclear weapons above as an example. There are numerous genocides throughout history. The death toll from just the flu alone is far greater that the potential damage for thousands of the people and objects we contain, and yet we dedicate ourselves to branding you anomalous. Something not normal. Something inherently wrong. Something that cannot be allowed its peace.

Why?

I'm not going to patronize you and say there's nothing I can do. I am only one voice on the Council, and I can't change things on my own, that's true, but the decisions I make, and the way I let myself view your circumstance are a direct cause of people seeing fit to throw you into a box. Even if I can't change the document, I could remain one more advocate for your normalcy. After all, humanity has believed in ghosts and spirits for thousands of years.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" We all believe in the monster under our beds when we're children. These phenomena are very real, and very much a part of the way the world works. Why can't we just declare them normal? Why won't I free you from your torment?

It's because we aren't only here to secure, contain, and protect the world. We're here to secure, contain, and protect you.

The defining feature of the anomalous is that it cannot be explained through simple scientific testing. This makes you and your nature different. Unique, even. And that scarcity makes it valuable. But that doesn't mean that your value is something everyone can appreciate. Sometimes, it can only be appreciated by those who would use it against you.

That scarcity is also the tool by which a monster can exploit you. Others aren't familiar with your anomaly, and won't respond to descriptions of it as real. This gives opportunity to nefarious individuals to exploit that lack of knowledge and use you as an eldritch pawn to their pleasure. They can isolate you, consume you, make your anomaly their lever to destroy, slake a sadistic thirst with your existence.

I'm sure you've seen it happen. Someone is different. Their desires, needs, their reality forces them to be ostracized by the world at large. They're left alone. Probably not friendless, but sidelined, starved for connection. That's when someone swoops in, promising greatness, but only offering that connection you crave through consumption of you, destruction of your world, perversion of your reality. You fight back, try to tell someone of your plight, but others respond, "Oh, that can't be happening. That's not real. You must be mistaken." You are alone in your anomaly, and left to suffer.

We can't let that happen. Yes, go ahead, point out that we're isolating you at least as well, slowly consuming you and your existence just as surely as some abuser might wish to burn you up. Call us monsters. It's okay.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" But keep in mind that even in our pursuit of you, our coverup, our incarceration of you, we still want to make sure that you continue to exist, that you aren't removed entirely from this world. You have every right to exist. You have every right to be as different as you are.

You, the monsters out there, the monsters in here, you are all just as real as we are. Just as real as the teeming, irrational, self-destructive humanity that remains ignorant to your plight. And the conclusion that we are all, in the end, the same stuff, I hope you can find comfort in it.

Yes, you are a monster. But, whether we are deemed anomalous or not, so is every last one of us. And that means you deserve your existence.

We secure you.

We contain you.

We protect you.

And even if you still don't get why I'm doing this, please understand that I still love you.

# Event #: EE-00059

Due to the nature of EE-00059, classification as a proper SCP is unnecessary.(.As of 04/24/2020, EE-00059 and all related documents are to be associated with SCP-001 as a primer for recently-declassified information.) Knowledge of the existence of EE-00059 is credited as non-anomalous due in part by successful disinformation campaigns; therefore, no containment measures are required at this point. Any information regarding transmissions or activity arising from EE-00059's vicinity is to be confirmed as legitimate, then handled by agents stationed in various relevant positions worldwide, including but not limited to observatories, places of academia, and media outlets such as television studios and radio stations. At this time, all data concerning the true nature of the event is considered purged from public knowledge.
Event Description: Extranormal Event 00059 was observed on June 14th, 2006, in a region of space roughly 1.6 billion light years from Earth,(. Therefore indicating its initial source to be ~1.6 billion years in the past.) located in the constellation Indus. It was detected via the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory telescope system as a prolonged gamma ray burst designated GRB 060614.""")

EE-00059-1 is an emergent Class-E "Momentary Lapse of Reason" Wormhole (S-CSMWAUC2T)(Spacial, Cycling Stability, Stationary, Manifested, Wide-Area, Uncertain, Conditional Two-Way, Transient. See: A Discourse on the Unification of Technological Canon, Vis-à-vis the Classification of Extradimensional Portals (i.e. Wormholes) and other similar case files for more information) that was observed for 102.0 seconds, during which it exhibited atypical behavior that contradicted all known theoretical and applied models of space-time folds.

During the event, EE-00059-1 was observed to behave in a manner that first resembled traditional Einstein–Rosen wormholes, emitting unidentified matter and light, while otherwise resisting the inbound flow of normal matter and fatal to organic life due to topological decoherence.(. Although topologically sound along their outer bounds, typical wormholes are not simply connected (n = 1) surfaces and thus possess ultra-compressed multidimensional topologies such as Calabi–Yau manifolds at their center.) Despite this, the region possessed a luminance several magnitudes greater than the predicted calculations implied, to an intensity only suggested to occur in white holes, which have never been observed.

Upon closer analysis, EE-00059-1 appeared to be exerting no effect on the surrounding space, evidence that implied the anomaly had little or no gravitational field. This is more consistent with Ellis drainholes, which are fully-transferable non-flat three dimensional regions of simply connected space-time folds.(Rμν−12Rgμν=−2(ϕ,μϕ,ν−12ϕ,κϕ,κgμν).) These paradoxical behaviors cannot co-exist at once, as each feature has physical consequence that manipulates the region's own scalar field into a state that, by definition, cannot support the initial conditions of the others.

EE-00059-2 is a series of low-frequency transmissions that originated from the direction of EE-00059, during which EE-00059-1 was observed.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" All transmissions were in an unknown language with phonetic structure bearing similarities to Sumerian and Mapudungun,(. A language spoken by some indigenous populations found in Southern Chile and Argentina.) however, said language also contained unique dialects consisting of a complex creole of other, unknown lexicons, as well as an unfamiliar syntactical structure.

Congnitohazardous glyphs embedded within the broadcast appeared to cause increased contextual/conceptual understanding of the meanings of the messages without need for direct translation. Combined with the atypical quality and range for transmissions to have originated from that distance, anomalous broadcasting equipment is suspected to have been used to send the messages (See EE-00059-2 Transcript Logs for more information).

On May 18th, 2027, the Foundation proposed the construction of the Altruist-9 deep space probe in order to observe the status of EE-00059's location, which was approved by a majority vote of the O5 Council.

In the event of EE-00059-1's reemergence upon contact with the location, the Altruist-9's support structures and core payload(. Containing a small, solar-powered autonomous drone and atmospheric measuring equipment.) are kept encased in an exotic polypeptide oligomer weave derived from the wreckage of SCP-001-E1.(See SCP-001 for more information)

Affectionately termed "Casimirium" after the Casimir-Polder force, this material possesses a non-baryonic lattice which generates a quantized field that cannot be altered by normal matter nor physical forces. This weave violates both mass-energy equivalence(E=mc2) and the averaged null energy condition(∫CTabkakbdλ≥0.) when placed inside non-trivial curved space-time, resulting in a polymer that will retain initial vector and relative dimensions without risk of decoherence during traversal through EE-00059-1.

In order to reach EE-00059 within a reasonable amount of time, the Altruist-9 was constructed with a prototype exotic faster-than-light (FTL) warp drive and high efficiency solar sails. However, in order to minimize adverse quantum effects resulting from interaction between curved space-time and the mixture of baryonic/non-baryonic matter used in the probe's inner construction, overall travel time will be increased drastically.

UPDATE:

The launch of Altruist-9 was successful, carried out on January 8th, 2038.

UPDATE:

On February 26th, 4783, the date of the Altruist-9's arrival into EE-00059's location, initial readings were recorded and proven to be non-anomalous.""")

Due to the atypical and intense nature of these manifolds, the Altruist-9 will not be recovered from contact with EE-00059-1. However, functional capabilities of the probe's inner core are considered to have survived traversal and will continue to make observations on EE-00059-1's opposite side until contact is reestablished on an unspecified date.

SCP-001-E1 is the designation for the remains of a superluminal interstellar ark recovered during an archeological expedition in the Atacama Desert of Chile between 1922-1946, led by American Paleontologist Dr. Hubert ███████. ███████ reported his findings to the Society for American Archaeology, piquing the interest of a number of different parties.(. Among those reported to have made inquires into the nature of SCP-001-E1 were a young Vincent Anderson and an individual named Robert Carter, although whether or not the latter was the Person of Interest with the same name remains to be seen.)

The remaining fragments of the ship's outer hull and mechanical components were excavated and found to be comprised of highly durable exotic polymers that appeared unaffected by time or exposure to the elements. Various dating methods have analyzed the material and yielded inconsistent results. Despite this, recovered information suggests the vessel was several billion years old.

Large areas of SCP-001-E1 appeared to have been converted into makeshift living space, implying the vehicle was intact when it landed and did not crash upon its arrival. In addition, remnants of personal effects such as clothing, electronics and furniture were recovered and contained, all possessing anomalous materials and abilities that resisted normal wear to varying degrees. The full size of the vessel is unknown but considered to be large enough to contain a substantial population of humans, the remains of which decomposed naturally, aside from POI-001, who was recovered from within SCP-001-E2.

SCP-001-E2 is a set of nine ten advanced cryogenic stasis pods discovered among the wreckage in a low-power "hibernation" mode during excavation of SCP-001-E1. Of the pods discovered, all but one were [DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST], with the final member, POI-001, possessing base physiology and brain activity expected from recovered imagery and records.""")

Also found among the rubble were several data storage devices that appeared to have been destroyed, despite being comprised of similar exotic materials as other items found inside SCP-001-E1, suggesting they may have been damaged with exotic/anomalous tools. Analysis was largely unsuccessful, with the only salvageable information recovered from a 4 cm3 fragment of compressed materials that form a complex, multilayered information medium presented as a set of vertical data stacks. The information recovered from the interpreted fragment were then translated from their original language, comprised of Class I cognitohazardous glyphs that appear similar to the engravings found on SCP-093.(. Multiple similarities have been noted in iconography as well as mythological materials recovered from UE-54701, suggesting [DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST])

These glyphs seem to cause a subjective "Rosetta Stone" effect in readers, allowing for nearly-full comprehension of the material regardless of known lexicons and proficiency.18 Analysis of the language is ongoing.

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Thaumiel

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is to be contained at Site-01. Under no circumstances are other anomalous objects to be contained in Site-01 due to the risk of injury to SCP-001. A cover story regarding the O5 Council not being permitted to come into contact with anomalous items is to be disseminated to conceal SCP-001's presence.

SCP-001 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber and guarded by six security personnel at all times. SCP-001 is to be accompanied by a medical team at all times in order to quickly correct any health issues that arise. Likewise, a team of neurosurgeons is to be kept on-site in order to correct any faults in SCP-001's calibrations. Cognito-agents present within SCP-001's consciousness are to be reinforced twice a day.

All research personnel directly working with SCP-001 are to be versed in thaumaturgy and Erikeshan conceptual engineering. To prevent a return to conceptual default in the event of SCP-001's impending death, Procedure Flamel-17 is to be executed immediately using D-Class personnel stored at Site-01.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

All information regarding the now-dissolved GOI-6616 ("The Eternal Circle") is to be removed from both public and general Foundation records, and is only to be available at the Site-01 Classified Archive.

Description: SCP-001 is an 84-year-old male who has been conceptually merged with the universal process of death. As such, by using SCP-001 as a catalyst, the process of death can be manipulated to a limited extent. For example, it is believed that the removal of SCP-001's tongue and damage to its eardrums inflicted prior to Foundation containment is the reason for the reduced rate of exclusionary 'Deal with Death' events in the modern age.(See A.A. Gilford's Vanishing Magic: The Erosion of the Cheated Death in the Thaumaturgical Archives for more information.)

Through a process of neurosurgery and cognito-therapy, SCP-001 has been successfully afflicted with a form of targeted(See Dr. Harold Gradian's The Fluidity of Perception: Amnestics in the New Millennium.) prosopagnosia; specifically, it is incapable of recognizing the faces of any members of the O5 Council. Due to its conceptual status, this incapability on its part becomes an incapability on the part of death by extension. As a result of this, all members of the O5 Council are unable to die or otherwise decay. This death-exempt status is scheduled to be extended to other vital personnel in the future.

It is believed SCP-001 was first created by a London-based organization called 'The Eternal Circle' using a combination of thaumaturgy and Erikeshan conceptual engineering. SCP-001 and records describing its creation by the group were recovered by personnel during a raid on its headquarters. The majority of the group's members were killed during this attack. When the potential uses of SCP-001 were realized shortly after acquisition, it was transferred to its current location at Site-01 and designated a Thaumiel-class anomaly.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Judging from SCP-001's physical condition and lack of response to stimuli, it is believed it suffered severe trauma during its time in GOI-6616's custody. Several thaumaturgical circles have been carved into its back as part of the process used to create it, and its limbs have been amputated at some point in the past.(Given the principles of Erikeshan conceptual engineering, this was presumably to reduce the size of SCP-001 before conceptual fusion.) Despite the severity of these injuries, they are not expected to cause difficulties in maintaining SCP-001 for the foreseeable future.

Procedure Flamel-17: In the event of SCP-001's impending death, the process used to create it is to be replicated using a suitable member of D-Class personnel as a base.(For information on the precise physical and genetic attributes required for SCP-001 candidacy, refer to Supplementary Document 001-1.) Younger D-Class candidates are to be given priority for this process, so as to increase the potential time of use of the new SCP-001. Following this procedure's completion, the original SCP-001 is to be terminated to facilitate full conceptual transfer.

Addendum 001-1:

From the desk of O5-1,

Recently, I have been made aware of concerns regarding the manner in which the Foundation is making use of SCP-001. I'd like to try and ease these concerns.

The actions we have taken here are ethically ambiguous. I freely admit that. What we are doing would be, in the eyes of most people, unforgivable. But we are no stranger to unforgivable things. No doubt that many of you working on this project have been forced to take similar actions in the past for the sake of the Foundation. For that, I am eternally grateful.

Had the group that created SCP-001 not been stopped, it is likely they would have used their newly-created 'death' in ways that barely approach the small measures we have taken. I assure you that, at the very least, you would not recognize the world outside your windows.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Death as a concept could have been warped catastrophically.

The measures we of the O5 Council have taken to preserve our lives are not an attempt to benefit ourselves. It is simply a preservation of resources — a way to keep the knowledge and experience gained through a lifetime of anomalous study safe. If even one of the O5 Council were to perish, it would be an unacceptable loss of resources. Thus, SCP-001 is an opportunity to preserve knowledge, to preserve experience. If a less regrettable means to this end were discovered, know that we would pursue it in a heartbeat. But right now this is the best we can do.

I understand your concerns. I do. But we at the Foundation must remember that, morally, we do not operate in the black or the white. We do not have the luxury. Only the grey is open to us.

CLASSIFIED - FOR EYES OF ETHICS COMMITTEE MEMBERS ONLY

IF YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO READ THIS DOCUMENT, AVERT EYES NOW TO AVOID MEMETIC KILL AGENTS EMBEDDED IN THIS TEXT
Following investigation into the situation involving SCP-001 and the O5 Council, this Committee has come to the conclusion that the actions of the Council are not acceptably justified by the duties of the Foundation. Together with the inherent issue of utilizing a humanoid SCP for the sole benefit of thirteen people, it is suspected that there have been a number of side effects to the concept of death as a result of their actions (see classified death figures enclosed). Requests by the Committee to cease these actions have been denied. Due to this, and several other ethical violations performed by the Council within the last six months, it is the opinion of this Committee that the Primary Action must be enacted.

As such, the following steps are proposed:

Deployment of Mobile Task Force Omega-1 ("Law's Left Hand") to secure and detain the O5 Council at their next scheduled meeting.
Removal of current O5 Council members from their positions.
Promotion of suitable high-ranking Foundation officials to O5 status.
Neutralization of SCP-001, so as to remove it as a temptation for future O5 Council members.
While the necessity for the Primary Action is regrettable, it is the opinion of this Committee that it is unavoidable at this juncture. When the actions of an O5 Council become targeted towards their own well-being rather than that of the Foundation, it is the duty of the Ethics Committee to undertake the action assigned to it by the Administrator upon its formation. This is not the first time the Primary Action has been executed, nor is it expected to be the last.

Voting on this proposal will take place after the next scheduled meeting of this Committee.

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Unnecessary

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 does not need to be contained.

In the event of SCP-001 occurring, all personnel, including D-class, are to be honorably discharged, and may do what they wish with their remaining time. All sapient and non-aggressive SCPs are to be released. Any further SCPs which can be decommissioned are to be. All remaining Foundation sites are to be run by the AIAD systems.

Specifically bred instances of SCP-514 are to be released globally.

Description: SCP-001 refers to an event occurring shortly before the cessation of all life on Earth. Whilst SCP-001 has not yet taken place, it was discovered through various pieces of information gathered from extra-universal Foundations and other similar groups (see attached document 001-A for a list of such communications).

It is important to note SCP-001 is not the cause of the apocalyptic scenario, merely a pre-occurrence response to it. SCP-001 is, according to records, distinctively recognised by certain key features.

During an SCP-001 event, flowers are observed to spontaneously appear and bloom over ~90% of the viable land surface of the planet. These flowers are universally referred to as "vibrant", "bright", "beautiful", and/or words to this effect. The weather will clear, globally, with an ambient temperature recognised as comfortable by the majority of the populace. Air pollution will additionally clear.

During an SCP-001 event, the global populace will become aware of the fate of the Earth, and of its inevitability. They will also experience heavily decreased levels of violence.

SCP-001 will occur exactly 24 hours before the death of all life on the planet.""")

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: ~~Keter~~ Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Following the recent investigations of Dr. Robert Montauk, no action is currently needed to contain SCP-001. It is functionally self-containing, and any Foundation interference may harm or alter its containment irreversibly.

No Foundation personnel are to engage with any new matters related to SCP-001, with the exception of related anomalies already in Foundation containment.

Description: SCP-001 is an entity ordinarily referred to as the Scarlet King. SCP-001 is currently located in several alternate dimensions simultaneously, and is unable to enter into the prime dimension. However, it is believed to have been repeatedly attempting entry for a period of several thousand under 300 years. SCP-001's physical, mental and conceptual properties are unknown to the Foundation; nevertheless, it continues to assert a strong influence on a number of individuals and events within the prime dimension.

It is believed that SCP-001's existence represents an ongoing but dormant Tashkent-Class "Cross-Pollination" Scenario1; should SCP-001 enter the prime timeline, an irreparable alteration to normalcy will occur. Containment of SCP-001 is a top priority is, however, unnecessary. Any attempt to alter SCP-001's classification or object class will result in immediate dismissal from the O5 Council.

References in art and oral tradition to SCP-001 appear across a wide variety of human and non-human cultures across the universe, including in communities which have never previously had any contact with one another. Common descriptions within these traditions are of a red creature of immense size, ordinarily wearing a golden crown or other headdress signifying royalty. Although the names ascribed to SCP-001 vary, the majority contain two elements: a word signifying some form of royalty combined with a word signifying the colour red.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Cultures which do not have a concept of the colour red but follow this naming pattern universally use a colour analogous to the English concept of the colour red.

Most personnel, except those working on anomalies related to SCP-001, possess no knowledge of the entity. As part of SCP-2317's containment procedures, Level 4 personnel2 are to be informed that SCP-2317 is, in fact, SCP-001. The truth of this is unknown, although it is a hypothesis which has received strong support among several members of the council. The apparently multidimensional nature of SCP-001, however, renders the possibility of SCP-2317 being anything more than a single aspect of SCP-001 unlikely.

It is unknown when SCP-001 was discovered. The loss of several archives concerning the Foundation's origins in the 1889 "Snarling Coup" has prevented a full reconstruction of events, although an investigation shortly following [DATA EXPUNGED]. A variety of groups dedicated to bringing SCP-001 into the prime dimension have existed over the years. The most recent of these has been the "Children of the Scarlet King", which was destroyed in a joint GOC-SCP operation in January 2018. Its former leader, Dipesh Spivak, is currently in Foundation custody under the designation PoI-3172.

Update 01/06/2018: SCP-001 has recently been the subject of an extensive investigation by Dr. Robert Montauk, Project Lead on SCP-001, SCP-231 and SCP-2317, and deviser of Procedure 110-Montauk.

Based on the results of this investigation, SCP-001 has been downgraded to Safe following a decision taken by the O5 Council.

<Begin Log>

PoI-3172: Again, Dr. Montauk? I don't understand what you people want from me.

Dr. Montauk: Hello to you too, Dipesh. I'm sorry to do this to you again. I think it's silly too, to be honest. What we want from you are answers.

PoI-3172: It's been, what- weeks, months? You've dragged me down here, into one of your interview rooms, and asked me these endless questions. You or one of your lackeys.

Dr. Montauk: I'm sorry if you've been made to feel uncomfortable. It wasn't my intention, but it's hard to keep tabs on everything any more. Have the guards been treating you badly in any way?

PoI-3172: No. No, not really. I can't really complain. It's just their eyes. They look so dead, so cold.

Dr. Montauk: If you like, I can rearrange some personnel and put someone else on your security detail. We're a bit short-staffed around here at the moment, and a lot of our best folks are away. And then there's the paperwork, and the endless oversight. There's been some trouble over with- well, you don't need to know about that.

PoI-3172: You weren't what I expected, you know.

Dr. Montauk: You thought the Foundation would be different?

PoI-3172: No. I thought you would be.

Dr. Montauk: You'd heard of me?

PoI-3172: Of what you've done. Procedure 110-Montauk, well… the people in my circles have done some dark things in their time, but that-

Dr. Montauk: I merely did what was necessary, Mr. Spivak. As a Foundation researcher, and as someone who doesn't want to see his loved ones die.

PoI-3172: Yes. That's very like the Foundation, isn't it? Everything done is justified by what is necessary. You see the world, the people moving through it, living lives touched only by totalising, universal laws of society and physics.""")

Dr. Montauk: You wouldn't say that if you worked here.

PoI-3172: Some of us called you evil. I don't think that's quite it.

Dr. Montauk: That is kind of you to say. And to tell you the truth, I don't think you're quite what I expected, either. Especially given your reputation.

PoI-3172: I've been told I am a hard person to get along with. Too "cryptic", they say. One person even called me "airy".

Dr. Montauk: I don't think I'd call you "airy". Your head may be in the clouds, but you seem to be maddeningly smug about it. Granted, not as smug as some of the delusional cultists who have passed through here. I suppose I should be thankful for that, at least.

PoI-3172: I'll try not to take that as an insult. But this is what I don't understand. Your procedure. 110-Montauk. It's not-

Dr. Montauk: I can't discuss that, I'm afraid. We must get on. Time and tide and all that rubbish. Please tell me what the Children of the Scarlet King's overall intention was.

PoI-3172: The Children are dead. There's not much left to tell you.

Dr. Montauk: I would like to hear things in your own words.

PoI-3172: Then I suppose you could say that our "intention" was to save the world.

Dr. Montauk: And how were you planning to go about doing that?

PoI-3172: By bringing the Scarlet King into this reality, of course. You know this already.

Dr. Montauk: But how would that save the world?

PoI-3172: Doctor, is this really necessary? You took away his daughters years ago and ended up killing most of them. You have already annihilated our society, and I'm sure you know all about what went on within it. We worshipped the King, pretending he was Satan or some other ancient god of evil. Our inner circle believed in violation as the ultimate holy act. We failed, you and the Bookburners destroyed us, and the matter has been put to rest.

PoI-3172: What else can I do? I know how this is going to play out. Maybe I always did.

Dr. Montauk: Why do you refer to the Global Occult Coalition as the "Bookburners"? Were you and your group affiliated with the Serpent's Hand?

PoI-3172: That's- it's complicated.

Dr. Montauk: It's a simple enough question.

PoI-3172: But there isn't a simple answer. Still… yes, we were affiliated with the Serpent's Hand. Most of us passed through there at one time or another. They will disavow us, of course, if you ask them about us. They're not monsters like we are. They have moral precepts, you see. Their whole point is to look for wonder, and since they see no wonder in the King, they repudiate us utterly. But they know, deep down, that they need us.

Dr. Montauk: They need you? What for?

PoI-3172: For the same reason they let us live. We raided the library, fought them, skirmished with them. They had a huge quantity of dirt on us, far more than you do. But they never finished the job. They're as bad as you Jailers, in their own way. The same compartmentalisation, the same singular goals. Their existence is based in nothing concrete. The empty time of history, that's all. Indeed, they came into being at the same time as you. You're more similar than you realise.

Dr. Montauk: That's impossible. The Serpent's Hand has been documented as existing long before the Foundation in any incarn-

PoI-3172: No, no, you miss the point. The Library's always been there, yes, but not the Hand. The Hand was something new, like you all are. You think anybody ever cared about "wonder" in the old days? Nobody cared about wonder. They cared about food, family and blood.

Dr. Montauk: What's that supposed to mean?

PoI-3172: It means… ah, you wouldn't get it anyway. But the Hand would. I think even the Bookburners do, in their own way. But the Hand is scared. They try to blot us out, forget us.""")

Dr. Montauk: Look, Dipesh, I have tried to make things more comfortable for you, but we need some give and take. You're speaking in clichéd, cryptic riddles, and I want some answers.

PoI-3172: I can't tell you everything. You wouldn't treat the information properly. You'd treat it as scientific fact; something to be swallowed, understood, contextualised.

Dr. Montauk: And what is wrong with that?

PoI-3172: Why are you doing this, doctor? Why are you dredging this stuff up again?

Dr. Montauk: I shouldn't tell you, but… ahh, screw it. I'm tired of this. I've been working on SCP-001 for two decades. Project lead for almost 9 years, after I came up with the Procedure. I don't know. I'm tired. Everywhere I turn I see the Scarlet King, but nothing about him makes any sense. Some big horned devil? Arcane blood god? It's all so small, so obvious. The Foundation has changed in the last decade, you see. We've faced conceptual demons, malevolent genre dwellers, sevenfold destroyers, all of which are far worse than some old sacrifice deity. But there, behind everything, I see this smile in fire. That dread, that old dread, it lingers. And this is despite seeing horrors far less easy and far more subtle trying to break the world on a daily basis. I just want to understand, I suppose. Peel back the layers, the tales upon contradictory tales, and find out who he really is.

PoI-3172: You're being awfully candid.

Dr. Montauk: To be honest, I've stopped caring. This job gets to you. The things you have to do, the regrets… well, I'm too high-up for anybody to touch me now, and I've run into too many dead ends to get hung up over protocol by this point. Just tell me something, Dipesh. Anything.

PoI-3172: OK. Look. I like you, Montauk. You must be a cold-blooded bastard somewhere in there, or you wouldn't have come up with- well. Who am I to judge, eh? I'll tell you where to start.

Dr. Montauk: I'm all ears.""")

PoI-3172: There are three things to understand about the Scarlet King. Three laws which, when put together, make up a complete picture. One is the law of blood. One is the law of concrete. And one is the law of howling.

Dr. Montauk: Three laws, eh? That the King set down for his followers, or that were imposed upon him?

PoI-3172: Both. The first was his law. The second was somebody else's. And as for the third, well, you'll find out about the third when you've cracked the first two.

Dr. Montauk: Very cryptic.

PoI-3172: That's all I can tell you for now. You need to learn in the proper way.

Document 2: The following is an extract from the memoirs of one Jack Hearst, a defector from the Children of the Scarlet King. Hearst was a high-level reality bender, capable of entering the bodies of humans in the past and experiencing their thoughts and emotions first-hand. The following is a description of what Hearst called the "Battle of the Ghemelleth", purportedly a battle between SCP-001 and his followers against a group called the "Children of the Urns". Hearst apparently experienced the battle from the perspective of a foot-soldier in SCP-001's army. These memoirs were written shortly before Hearst's death in 1976. They were among the first documents consulted by Dr. Montauk during his investigation.

The fortress was monumental, made of volcanic rock and jagged iron and built into a vast mountain. Every measurement, every angle was calculated to promote the King's ideology. The steel slats and bars may have seemed to be jutting out in random half-sawn directions, but if you could see the whole then you'd see the symmetry. It was a perfect expression of cosmic order, expressed in endless sevens.

It's a tough trip to remember, but bits and pieces come back. We were slaves, I think.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" We had been taken from a far-off land. The nobility looked down upon us with cruel eyes, but the King didn't care. He rewarded us, and so we were the instruments of his rule. When a village required the justice of the King, we would descend upon them with blood and iron. The villagers feared us, and that felt right to me. But when the horde came, with fire and burning and their cries of freedom, the villagers were still just as scared as they had been of us. That was not the fear of their master, I think, but the fear of anarchy. They didn't know which way to turn. In the end, most betrayed us. Many had had their daughters taken by our master. Old rites. Blood rites. Arcane rites.

But we stood upon the battlements, loyal to the last, our hearts bursting with happiness at the rightness of it all. I'm still not sure exactly what was going on- it was all so chaotic, and full of red smoke- but I could feel my host's bloodlust. We stood, and watched, and waited. The sound of rubble and explosions came from across the hill, and the last battle begun.

Then something strange happened. My host suddenly felt afraid, and he and I were somewhere else. The sky was not red but black. I was not a slave but part of a conscripted rabble. The peasants looked up at us. They were all starving. They held out their hands, begging, pleading, praying. The wind was their master, and it screamed at them. The horde was coming, but they, too, were starving.

Then the scene flickered back, and I was in my host again, under a scarlet sky. The King's voice raged. The rabble of his armies was fleeing to the gates, but they would not open. Our arrows, coated in flame and pitch, flew back again. But the horde was undaunted. In my mind I could see nothing but the fire, the fire of the king. I drew my sword. We all drew our swords. We all charged into the fray.

And then, as it were, the scene changed again.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" There were no battlements, only the dark sky and the wind and a more ragged and lonely sky. The peasants pleaded, the nomads laughed, cheered, wept. "The wind will rage no more!" they said.

The two scenes shifted in and out. A red fort bled into a black field. I have ruminated on it a long time, but I think they were the same battle, seen through two different eyes. Or at least the memories of two different battles. The whole thing felt strange; it was not like most of my trips. It was like a half-remembered cacophony, two ideas ripping at each other. There was a timeline showing what really happened, in that blackened wasteland. And there was one that had been made to be true, imposed throughout time on the truth.

The last thing I remember was being sliced by a nomad sword, of a frail urn being held high, of seven brides being ripped from a castle- or were they ripped from a field, taken as the spoils of war by some obscure tribe in some lost steppe? I remember the King screaming, writhing, thrashing as he was sealed.

And then I died, and woke up back at the ritual. For a second, I wondered if the others had just made up the King, and sent some image of him back to the past. But I don't think that was true. They lacked the power; and besides, it was never a total lie. There was something in that wicked wind that reminded me of some of the older rituals.

It was then that I decided to leave the Children. I went that night, without a word. They didn't stop me; probably figured it wasn't worth the effort. They were so certain in the success of their mission. But I wanted no part in that any more. The things I saw were based upon the law of blood, and I can only pray that they never come to pass.

It is believed that the Children of the Scarlet King manipulated state officials into the demolition over the course of several years, and that this splinter group continued their work as the original Children went into decline.	

Result:  Attempt prevented by a Foundation raid.

GOI: Red Guards	

Details of Attempt: Appeared to be using the blood, bones and spinal fluid of several animals, combined with ritual chanting, to create a portal to SCP-001. A large number of SCP Foundation logos, carved out of bone, were placed around the ritual site in a defensive position; these logos were slightly incorrectly carved.	 

Result:  Attempt not detected by any GoI, and came extremely close to success. However, it appears a critical mistake in the words of ritual instead resulted in a large explosive blast, destroyed all of the assembled members of the Guards. It remains unknown why the Guards apparently wished to invoke Foundation protection for their ceremony.

Dr. Montauk: How on earth-

PoI-3172: Oh, he embellished. He didn't leave straight away; I stumbled upon some early draft in his things, shortly before he left.

Document 5: The following is a page from the 1891 report of Agent de Beauvoir on lost Foundation archives following the 1889 Snarling Coup. The report was lost shortly after de Beauvoir's termination in 1895, along with several other documents from the Foundation archives. This page was recovered through unknown means by Dr. Montauk; no other materials from these data losses have been found.

In summary, the documents lost are extremely extensive, covering a wide range of data concerning the Foundation's early history. Of particular note are several documents related to SCP-001 which have gone missing. However, my investigations have provided me with a great deal of information, and I believe that I can say with some certainty that the historical record as stated in Scranton's Comprehensive History remains broadly intact, albeit with some modifications I will detail below.

Scranton's work states that the Foundation was founded in 1824, by the merger of thirteen worldwide organisations with a particular interest in preventing awareness of anomalous activities. The most prominent of these were the Foundation of the Secure Containment of the Unnatural, the Devan-e Jaaduyih, the Unified Sites of the Department of Unexplained Affairs, the Council of Five Overseers and the Commitee of Paranormal Ethics. Scranton goes on to tell us that this was done in response to the threat posed by SCP-001, and that the early Foundation had an extensive role to play in that anomaly's containment.

However, the documents I have before me present a rather different picture. It appears that the Foundation was not founded in response to SCP-001 at all. Indeed, I cannot find any references to the present SCP-001 prior to 1826.

The sin of modernity is vital to understand. It is not that we glorify the premodern. The suffering was very real and very extant. We must not fall into the trap of seeing the past as a series of beautiful Arcadias, full of dancing around maypoles and shepherds living in pleasant anarchy.

The past was brutal, but it was also real. It wasn't really the "premodern", too; that is merely how historians have characterised it. They are wedded to their theory of modernisation and can conceive of no alternate mode of development other than a singular drive towards the contemporary West, with other modes of living seen as being stuck in some imagined earlier place on a timeline. It's all nonsense. The people of the past were capable of seeing the world as it really is.""")

But there is no other way to live. Socialism, anarchism, syndicalism- these are little more than constructed pipe dreams, the frail thoughts of lesser men trying to impose their antiquated prejudices on the world around them. No, there is only one alternative way to live. To cast down the law of concrete is to raise up the law of blood.

We must learn what it is to die. To be enslaved- truly, brutally enslaved, with no compassion or compunction from our masters. We must learn what it is to be taken towards a single purpose, to know and truly understand our lack of agency. We must be beholden to a world of gods and darkness, the tempest-tossed refuse of a race of fools. We must kill modernity, postmodernity, with all its analysis and sneering observation.

PoI-3172: Hello, Dr. Montauk. I hope that our last meeting…?

Dr. Montauk: I am sorry for my unprofessional behaviour. You… touched upon a sore subject.

PoI-3172: Of course. I will try to refrain from doing so in future.

Dr. Montauk: Shall we begin?

PoI-3172: This time, doctor, I have a question for you.

Dr. Montauk: Indeed? I suppose it can't be worse than your last.

Dr. Montauk: He has changed the past?

PoI-3172: No, his past has been changed for him. But now you tell me something. This should be a give and take, after all.

Dr. Montauk: That is not what-

PoI-3172: Why did you approve the Montauk procedure?

There is a pause here for several seconds as Dr. Montauk stares at PoI-3172.

PoI-3172: I am sorry if I have offended you.

Dr. Montauk: I thought I made it clear that this is none of your business.

PoI-3172: See, the thing I don't get is that it should not have worked. Not in the way the Foundation does-

Dr. Montauk: This is not under discussion.

PoI-3172: What happened to Jacob, doctor? What happened to your brother?

Dr. Montauk: This interview is-

PoI-3172: Oh, alright, alright. I am sorry. I am not trying to hurt you, doctor, truly. I just want to understand. It's just- it shouldn't have worked. The child should have been born.

There is a pause of several seconds.

Dr. Montauk: I… was angry. When I drew it up. It was unprofessional.

PoI-3172: Did you think we took Jacob?

Dr. Montauk: Well, what the hell was I supposed to think? I start looking into your lot, making discovery after discovery, and then he disapp- look, this isn't relevant.

PoI-3172: Alright, alright. I am sorry I asked. But can we agree that it was not a decision made scientifically? That it was done in a moment of fury, rage, hate?

PoI-3172: But you did, doctor. Look, I'm sorry, I don't mean to dredge these old wounds up for you-

Dr. Montauk: Why are you, then?

Your procedure keeps the girl from giving birth, the nomads keep fighting their endless war, the spears are safely locked away by the Bookburners, and the Devourer- well, there's nothing you can really do about the Devourer now, is there?

Dr. Montauk: SCP-2317 isn't SCP-001.

PoI-3172: Wasn't SCP-001. But the thing is, you've been telling everyone he is. Technically, you're meant to think that he is, if I understand Foundation hierarchies correctly. You are only a level 4, after all.

Dr. Montauk: I don't understand.

PoI-3172: Across every culture, in every city and tribe and civilisation, you've come across the idea of the Scarlet King. Always the same: an emperor in red, with a burning crown and an ethos rooted in some archaic fear of female sexuality. He is always the same: a monster that is all-consuming and terrible, but so understandable. The big bad thing in the dark, full of rape and fire and old blood-ritual. Does it never strike you as odd that this is the thing behind the eyes? You've faced monsters far grander and more subtle, as you told me yourself. But always, always there's that lingering fear and knowledge of this hidden but oh-so-simple thing standing behind it all.

Dr. Montauk: You know it strikes me as odd. I told you as much myself. But I also stopped trying to make sense of our world a long time ago. The anomalous does not play by the rules of man. I'm too old to start redefining the universe.

PoI-3172: But the thing you don't remember, or don't know, is that this wasn't the only past. The Scarlet King used to be something very different. He wasn't a monarch, and he wasn't always red. He was the whisper on the wind that kept the peasants working, staring up in fear of his righteous famine. He was that inborn knowledge of a world of gods and demons which belied human agency and existed beyond us.""")

PoI-3172: The Scarlet King is not a deity, doctor. The Scarlet King is an idea.

Dr. Montauk: Wh- what? But he's real- physical! We've seen-

PoI-3172: I can't tell you any more. Not yet. Did you find anything out about the law of concrete?

Dr. Montauk: …No. Not much. I found out that there seems to be a disturbing correlation between the activities of the King's followers and certain decisions made by the Council.

PoI-3172: I see.

Dr. Montauk: But there wasn't much else at all. The trail led me to some lost documents, but eventually all I found was a dead end. A document about the Foundation's origins, and some insane old Child ranting on about modernity.

PoI-3172: Cartwright, I presume? That makes sense.

Dr. Montauk: You are a maddeningly infuriating person, you know. Why can't you just tell me this stuff properly?

PoI-3172: I am your prisoner. You did destroy my life's work. Why should I help you?

Dr. Montauk: Because you're bored. Because you think none of this matters. And because you love tormenting me.

PoI-3172: I don't, you know.

Dr. Montauk: The Scarlet King is an idea? What the hell is that meant to mean?

PoI-3172: You're close now, doctor. Close to the truth. I can see it in you. You will understand, and then you'll understand me. Why I did what I did. Why I am- was- a member of the Children. I know you're curious.

Dr. Montauk: You do seem oddly well-adjusted to be a Satan worshipper.

Document 9: The following is a translated excerpt from the 1953 Bengali work Lāla Rājā.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The work had been lost for some time, and rediscovered by Dr. Montauk in the course of his investigation.

And so as British rule continued, something began to come with them, piece by piece. A shadow, at first; a red thing. But it was not whole. It was not even in pieces. It was something that crept up slowly, piece by piece. It met the shadows of our country, the mice bleeding in the rice fields, and it began to take form.

It didn't have a mind. Not at first. It wasn't enough of a real thing yet to have one. It was a set of images. It was a blood-red slab of skin, taken from the heart of some Christian demon, which was set upon an ancient magician of Hindu rites. But then it was categorised, written down, described with precise scientific terminology. It didn't like that. Things of magic, technology, empire that were never meant to mix all came together, and began to bend the nature of the world.

As Europe came to us more and more, as we learnt to be "civilised", our religion began to change too. Anantashesha was not an ancient and capricious god in the form of an immense snake- it was a moray eel of scientifically unusual size, noted for producing amnesiacs3 and causing a cognitohazardous effect. We learnt that we were Hindu, that we always had been Hindu, and that all our various and mixed beliefs were all variations on a singular ideal, because the British weren't comfortable enough with another way of living which could not be classified, explained, killed like a butterfly pinned to a board.

But beneath this lay a fury. A cry for authenticity, for a reality, even as we expressed ourselves more and more in their language and their categories, even in our struggle against them. It lay in our literature, in Tagore and the others; it lay in our adda4, in our menial jobs as clerks. The endless, struggling tension between old and new, between modernity and premodernity.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" And in those fault-lines, in that cry of rage and fury, in our hatred of the old and the hatred of the new, there rose a hybrid obeying nothing but the law of the howling. There rose the Lāla Rājā.

Because what is he but the cry for a forgotten age? He is the British peasant staring up at the red sky, the Bengali widow's weeping and shaven head, the Aztec priest ripping out another's heart. He is all of those things transformed, as modernity does to everything, into modernity's own destruction. He is the resistance, the fury, the hatred of all that was for all that presently is.

What we were was full of good and evil and all else mixed together. The happiness, the beauty of the world, the struggles and heartache and reality of it all. But now we have lost almost all of it to the machine- except our rage. That's all that's left. And thus comes the King. The howl of the destroyed and forgotten and oppressed. His only purpose is to destroy, rape, maim, enslave and smile, smile that smile of a king whose enemies weep before him.

He cannot exist where there is no modernity, because his entire purpose is given to him by modernity. He is a god of blood, a god of spine and bone and sinew, to remind the denizens of this world that it is not good. It is cruel and hateful and that is good, that is right. Modernity is a sin and he is the correction, so that we can once again live as we must: cold, and hungry, and starving, and very, very afraid.

Dr. Montauk: I… I had nothing to ask you.

PoI-3172: I thought so. You have deduced the truth, haven't you?

Dr. Montauk: Maybe. Yes.

The crack shrinks slightly.

Dr. Montauk: It- did that just-

PoI-3172: It grows and shrinks depending on the situation. Different actions have different meanings, and thus different effects. It all depends on context. The other Children never got that, but- well, they never got anything, really. They thought we were all devil worshippers, heading for violation. Only I understood the point.

Dr. Montauk: It took me a while to understand.

PoI-3172: I didn't think you would.

Dr. Montauk: Just tell me- did the Procedure even matter? What we do, is it even relevant?

PoI-3172: To prevent the birth, it had to be something awful, something evil expressed in pain and rage and fury. That is why it worked. It was never a sincere attempt to formulate a scientific procedure on your part: it was just pure, unadulterated hatred wrapped in a veneer of objectivity. You thought the King had taken your brother, so you decided to hurt the King. You didn't, of course, and what you do each day to that poor girl is little more than mere cruelty. But effective cruelty. The specifics are unimportant but the intent, that matters for everything.

Everything had to be understood, contextualised, transformed from faerie and godhood into simple, comprehensible chunks of logic and matter. It's abhorrent. And it could never go on forever. Something had to give. Something had to rise up in opposition.

That is the luxury of modernity, despite its coldness and its creaking wounds- to be able to be a full person. Seven, seven, seven. Seven girls taken away by raiders in the cold, as the wind demon howled and howled. So the Scarlet King had to have seven brides.

Dr. Montauk: Modernity is not always cold. It's less brutal than slavery.

PoI-3172: But what is it for? Is that the only purpose, a mere absence of brutality? What's the point of having peace and kindness for its own sake, so you can smile for a few decades before falling dead into an empty grave? Self-affirmation for a finite self. I don't understand it. I never did. I grew up trying. I wanted to be like them, like you, but the system just stared down at me with contempt. Maybe it's not coldness, doctor. Coldness seems too objective. It can't be that, because there is no objectivity. There's just the screaming and the madness and the need for purpose.

Forged from a perfect balance of irreconcilable anomalies and our breaking minds. He is an entity created by this overwhelming, unavoidable tension. Of the howl of the old world when faced with a cold, grey, purposeless new. He is the revenge of our fallen past. He is the idea of the ancient in a world which discards and fetishises it.

Document 12: The following is a record of O5 Council Vote #4985.

Council Vote #4985, "Vote to approve suggestions made by Dr. Robert Montauk on Foundation Operating Procedures for improved containment of SCP-001." Proposed by O5-13 on 30/05/2018.

For: 05-02,05-06,05-07,05-10,05-13

Against 05-01,05-03,05-08,05-09,05-11,05-12

Abstained: 05-04,05-05

Vote Denied.

Statement by O5-1: Dr. Montauk's investigations have been most illuminating. They have certainly raised serious concerns about how the Foundation has been operating in recent years. But we feel that his suggestions go too far.

The ethos of the Foundation is comprehension. Postmodern notions of the fallibility of objective universal truths are all very well in academic circles, but the Foundation has always been first and foremost concerned with practicalities, basing its analyses on the hard sciences and unquestionable truths. Changing our intentions and modus operandi is, frankly, an absurd proposition. Our duty is, and always has been, to die in the dark to protect those in the light.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" If we begin to abandon or redefine the notion of what dark and light are, we risk a sharp descent into tyranny, incoherence and the loss of our mission entirely. This must not happen. We cannot engage in cavalier redefinitions of what the Foundation's very essence is.

We thank Dr. Montauk for his work, and we will be accordingly updating SCP-001's classification to Safe as a result of it. Containing SCP-001 is no longer as difficult as it once was, despite its potential danger; if Montauk's information is correct, then it seems clear to us that the Foundation should simply take a more laissez-faire attitude towards SCP-001's containment. We look forward to a more productive containment relationship with our oldest anomaly going forward.

I watched, hidden, as their bulldozers came. Prime land wasted on trees, they said. They ripped them up, sliced their roots, took them away to be made into tables, chairs or other monotonies. Then, over weeks and months, they flattened it. They poured concrete into the rest. It was scraped and shaped, cut into neat little squares, arranged precisely and in an orderly fashion.

Walls rose up, great walls of concrete. Windows, their measurements precisely regulated. A series of standardised bricks for other parts. Construction crews and workmen and all the rest, working efficiently and precisely for a long time; filling in the details, the furnishings and precise abstract wallpapers and everything else that went into making a facility.

Finally, it was finished. One single, new tree had been planted in the centre of the central courtyard; not through any sense of whimsy or delight, but to give those within a little sense of nature, of reality in the centre of the grey.

I thought about hollow men, made of straw, plastered together with thick paste and sold in a hundred, a thousand identical ways in a thousand identical shops. I thought about what we had lost.

At night, the day before the site's grand opening, I dug up the seeds of the tree, and replaced them. With a seed of my own devising. And over Site 231 will stand a thing of blood and bone and sinew. A tree that drips and leers and feeds. It will drip strange fire, and that fire will both burn and warm in equal measure.

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Due to its relatively benign nature, SCP-001 has been classified as Safe and no attempts to locate or directly contain it are to be made at this time. Containment efforts are to focus on the products that it generates, which are to be assigned individual designations and special containment procedures.

Description: SCP-001 is a male human known as "Dr. Wondertainment". It is a Class-I reality bender capable of imbuing otherwise-mundane creations with anomalous properties, focusing its abilities on the creation of toys, board games, candy, and various other products marketed at children. It distributes these items via anomalous means from an unknown location.

Product examples include paper that takes on the properties of whatever shape it's folded into, a playset capable of creating animate shadows, and lollipops that allow people to switch voices.

Addendum 001/1 - History: Due to the elusive nature of the entity, very little is currently known about SCP-001's past. That said, it is known that he was born and raised in a small village, the son of a seamstress and a chartered accountant. Seemingly set to lead a life of quiet desperation in a grey and boring world, he found joy solely in the stories that his father would tell him before bed each night, stories of a marvelous toymaker who made wonders that the world had never seen before nor since. A toymaker who, according to SCP-001's father, was a distant relative of theirs, and whose blood ran through the young SCP-001's veins.

After he grew up, SCP-001 sought the truth of the stories, intent on reclaiming his birthright. He followed any lead he could find, seeking out even the vaguest rumors of dolls that came to life, jumping jacks that really jumped, cuckoo clocks that sang and danced without even a single cog or spring within.""")

He had found The Factory.

The Factory was a trap. It stole SCP-001 and put the young man to work within its grey walls of concrete and steel. It forced him to take part in its mockery of creativity until he almost broke. But instead he escaped, escaped with stolen documents that led him to a cottage deep in the woods, the source of the magic that The Factory had taken and twisted to its own ends.

He entered the cottage, and there he found the workshop of his ancient ancestor. With a small, satisfied smile, he read through the journals and notes and designs. With a soft twinkle in his eye, he took up the tools of his new trade. And finally, with a deep sigh of pure contentment, he-

No.

No no no no.

It is most famously responsible for the creation of the Little Misters™ line of collectible living action figures that have inspired many imitators but no substitutes. Examples include Mr. Fish, Mr. Laugh, Mr. Soap, and Ms. Sweetie.

It is also also known that he doesn't actually exist at all and is merely a manifestation of fun and delight that sprang fully formed from the imagination of every child around the world.

Whatever his origin, he is a truly grand old chap, capable of creating wonder with a wave of his hand, entertainment with a snap of his fingers, and whimsy with a wink of his eye.

Special Containment Procedures: Due to the excessive amount of product that it outputs on an annual basis, SCP-001 has been classified as Keter and is to be shut down as soon as a practicable method of doing so has been developed. Until such time, containment efforts are to focus on the products that they generate, which are to be assigned individual designations and special containment procedures.

Though I have to say that, given the varying nature of our relationship over the years, I hardly expect that a single Foundation employee that's been reading this has believed a word of it anyway.

This was all that Dr. Johnathan West had managed to get written down before the phrasing of the actual document eluded him. It was no small task, authoring a file for SCP-001. Others had done it before him, for other anomalies that were considered important enough. That's what an 001 draft came down to— importance.

"Wait, shit." He cursed. "Archon's non-standard. Should probably put something there."

Object Class: Archon1

"That's better." He looked down at his watch and sighed. Writer's block. What a thing for a scientist to have.

It's not like 001 was a secret among anyone at Site-87. It was a big event, and several others were co-authoring the draft with him, giving feedback and fixing up sections. It was a group effort, like much of what happened at 87. But it was make-or-break; the credibility of the site rested upon it.

"Dammit." He stared as the watch's hand ticked towards 5:00. Well, he still had another month to finish up this proposal — and besides, tonight was the weekly poker game.

He saved his work, shut off his monitor, and went up to the common area on Sublevel 3.

An Archon-class will literally break the world if you contain it."

"It's been boring here without ya, Jay," Bailey admitted, adding, "There's nowhere near enough insect-related hallucinations without you."

"I am a sorcerer, not a gambler. I'd have an unfair advantage over you all— a word of clairvoyance, and I can see all of your hands." Reynolds was talking out his rear— he was a horrible gambler.

He'd done that by bringing him here.

He looked at a picture on his desk, one which displayed a younger version of both himself and Verhoten, standing by Gray Lake and looking out at the only lake monster who wasn't anomalously blurry on film. A conversation creeped back into his mind.

"Johnny," Verhoten began, "You're going through what a lot of newbies in the Foundation go through. You're sick of all the death and destruction and nihilism, and you want to know there's something worth saving."

"Don't put words in my mouth," West snapped. "The world's not going to end in nuclear fire, big deal. Some rotted corpse is going to break out of its cell and eat children, or else a giant slug is going to crawl out of the sea, or we're going to be assimilated into a massive machine—"

SCP-001 is observable through use of narrative exploitation techniques.

Doing so will invoke an alteration in SCP-001, dubbed SCP-001-A.

SCP-001-A instances take several forms, and usually are of a nature that would typically be conducive to telling a compelling narrative from an outsider's perspective.

"Still can't believe that you wrote a script for this," Reynolds frowned. "That thing's probably just going to scare him off."

"No good slasher villain can resist a pair of horny— well, 'horny' —" she made the air-quotes visible" —thirty-and-forty-somethings. Not as effective as teenagers, but none of the Baileys were available."

"You know, they have a whiteboard here at Site-87, trying to document their own timelines. From 2005 to now, they have a gigantic space that just reads 'weird temporal bullshit'." Reynolds looked at the script. "If I didn't love you…"

"There's no universe where that's possible," Sinclair rolled her shoulders, and looked at the script. "From the top."

Reynolds rolled his eyes. "'C'mon, baby, do you wanna die a virgin?'"

"'I ain't dyin' anytime soon… Derrick." Sinclair suddenly regretted her choice of name for this experiment. "'I'm gonna live long enough to fuck a million other guys before' oh my god this is awful.""")

Reynolds leaned down to kiss her. "Well, it appears to have done something right." He nodded to the Narrative Fluctuation Detector— it lit up bright green.

Out of the shadows, a large, black shape leaped, bringing its axe between them, splitting the ground at their feet. They jumped back, staring at the Goatman.

The Goatman frowned, letting out a huff and recovering the hatchet. He looked at them, the script, and the Detector, shaking his head, a wild tangle of hair covering his horns. "Aren't you a bit old for this?"

"We're doing tests," Sinclair shrugged. "Give us a break."

The Goatman snorted. "Last great secret of this town, the Narrative, and you've figured it out." He hefted his hatchet, tilting his head. "How'd you do it?"

Tristan Bailey was working on his tablet when he nearly walked into Dr. Sinclair in the elevator. As the doors closed behind him, he muttered an apology, and looked at the screen at the back of the car. The screen behind them displayed a picture of Phillip Verhoten, a South African man in his sixties with skin the color of finished mahogany, smiling behind a pair of glasses. He was superimposed in front of his books with an announcement scrolling overhead: "Philip Verhoten, Author of The Crossroads, Atrium 2. Don't miss it!"

Sinclair looked at Bailey, a soft frown on her face. "I've been reviewing your contributions to the 001 file. I… found an issue."

"Oh?" Tristan frowned.

Sinclair pulled out her own tablet and highlighted the problematic section, which she had crossed out.

In contrast to what was theorized in S. Andrew Swann's SCP-001 Variant, the entity or entities responsible for constructing the baseline narrative, for the most part, do not appear to be actively malevolent, but they are perverts.

"That last part is really unnecessary." Sinclair scowled at Bailey.""")

"People put jokes or goofs in non-finalized drafts all the time. I seem to remember someone getting a reprimand because they accidentally left a certain foxy name within a report."

Sinclair glowered at Tristan. "You said you'd never mention the Sinclair/Synner incident." She muttered.

"Not my fault you're horrible at picking character names," Bailey said as the elevator doors opened. "Your test in the woods reveal anything?"

"The Goatman was oddly talkative," Sinclair admitted. "We told him how we figured out what we did to discover the Narrative, and he gave us, well, questionable data."

"Like what?" Bailey stepped out of the elevator, walking alongside Sinclair.

"So, the whole concept Swann's proposal put forth, the progenitor universe that writes all of our lives? He says that may not actually be the case." She rubbed her temples. "It's confusing. We may not be fictional, but our world operates on the rules of fiction, so it kind of is."

"Well, even if we aren't fictional, we still operate on the rules of it, so same difference." Bailey took out his phone and leaned against the wall. "Anything else?"

"Yeah. He said that," She shook her head and let out a soft chuckle. "He said that it may be alive."

"It?" Bailey raised an eyebrow. "The Narrative?"

"He said that it was 'a spirit' that was alive in Sloth's Pit. It can… react, and be talked to." Sinclair scoffed. "That would explain why we can manipulate it."

"I dunno." Bailey paused and scratched his head. "It can react, but it doesn't seem alive; it's more like it has chemical reactions to certain phrases. Trying to actually communicate with it is absurd. It'd be like trying to have a conversation with hydrochloric acid."

"I'm skeptical too," Sinclair admitted, continuing to walk on. "You have to admit, it does seem to have a sense of humor at times.""")

Bailey started walking again, looking at a monitor in the hallway displaying an announcement from Director Weiss that testing in the biology sublevel was to be halted until E-2913 could be recaptured. "Yeah, maybe, but it's always cringe humor, slapstick, and bad puns. There's never any irony."

"And now that you've said that, there probably is."

"Nah," Bailey said, moving past Sinclair to the coffee machine— not the coffee machine, unfortunately ("Friggin' Site 19 gets everything good", Bailey muttered to himself.) "What, now that I've said that, am I suddenly going to win the lottery? The odds of—" He blinked, his hands over the keys to input his order; he glanced behind the machine, and saw a stub of paper sticking out from behind it. "The fuck?"

"There's a scratch-off card behind here."

"Five grand from a random scratch-off ticket created by exploiting the narrative. Not bad, Bailey." Pike raised the pot. "Now you have some scratch to lose to me. But… you know you're not supposed to do that for personal gain, right?"

"I didn't mean to! It's like it messed with me." Tristan called Pike's bet, knowing she had the better hand. "West, I looked over Pickman's observations again. I think that… the narrative might be selective."

"Selective?" West snorted. "That implies that it's sentient, if not sapient." He looked pointedly at one of the walls in the room. "Probably just someone beyond the fourth wall messing with you."

"Yeah, but— mmmn." Tristan sighed. "It's too responsive to be random chance, but too inconsistent to be something like a chemical reaction. I dunno."

"Lines up with what the Goatman said," Sinclair admitted. "'The Spirit of the Narrative is more alive here than in other places'."

"You think he meant an actual spirit." Hendricks squinted his eyes. "A global… what's it called?"

"Harry said I should do that. I'm gonna check." West tapped his fingers against the table. "Not a bad idea."

"This kind of… de-explains the 'god is a bunch of horror writers' concept that Swann put forth, though." Sinclair shook her head. "Not sure how I feel about that."

"I thought it was bullshit when I read it," Tristan admitted. "Trev told me they sometimes put fake 001 instances in the database to throw off leaks. I know the Broken God one is mostly accurate, Gate Guardian is real, but beyond that, it's all up in the air."

"We have the remains of the Gears proposals in storage on-Site." Pike drew incredulous looks from the rest of the table. "What? It's common knowledge. The remains are inert, anyway."

Description: SCP-001: Alive? Narrative conscious? World-window? More tests required.

"Is there any way to test if it is alive?" Pike frowned at her cards— King and an Ace weren't gonna help much with a turn like this. "Like— malignant narrative isn't all that uncommon. From the tests we did, it's actually pretty easy to make."

"How would this test work?" West asked, scribbling down more.

Reacts to malignant narrative removal?

"Well…" Sinclair looked at the scars on her arms, before turning a page on the notepad, rolling up her sleeves, and starting to scribble on the paper. "If it is alive, then it might be possible to create a spell that could make its pain manifest, or otherwise detectable. I can have it ready tonight; we just need malignant narrative."

"How do we achieve that?" Pike was folding now to focus on the discussion, much to Hendricks's chagrin. Bailey had just turned over an Ace in the river. "One of the easiest ways we found was to achieve an anti-climax, but those aren't easy to accomplish— not intentionally."

Bailey himself folded, joining in. "Well, we could—"

Hendricks threw his pair of twos on the table, and stood. "There's your goddamn anticlimax! Four of a kind, and you all fold!"

The air within the room felt like it had grown denser. Everyone went silent, and Sinclair pulled out a portable Narrative Fluctuation Detector wand. The lights on it blinked a bright, dangerous red.

"Hendricks," Sinclair laughed. "I could kiss you."

"You know, it occurs to me that the narrative may have made itself malignant." West frowned as Sinclair finished the circle of chalk on the tile floor. "It forced an anticlimax so we could detect it— that's assuming that Bailey's hypothesis of it being alive holds true.""")

"There's an incantation on the back of my notepad I need you to read once I finalize the spell vector."

"It's not in dog Latin, is it?" Hendricks crossed over to the abandoned poker table and picked up the notepad, trying to ignore the hushed whispers from outside the room. People from throughout the site had gathered around to see if the narrative— possibly the very fabric of the universe they lived in —was alive. He was fairly sure this was being livestreamed to Site-19 as well.

Cassandra Pike couldn't help but be satisfied at the fact that, over six months after his death, Pickman would be vindicated. She'd always had a soft spot for the old archivist; when her medication failed to be delivered to any pharmacy in town, he'd let her help organize the archives. He'd been dead for months, but now he was helping the Foundation make a giant leap.

Tristan was just glad that the chucklefucks at 19, the ones who had his brother demoted for daring to do his job and neutralize a Keter-class anomaly, were going to eat crow. The family name was mud since Trevor did what he did; he was about to wipe that off.

"Fuck me, is this Sumerian?" Hendricks frowned. "Sinclair, you know my cuneiform's rusty. There's a ritual in Old French that can accomplish the same thing."

Sinclair, West, Bailey, Pike, and the rest of the onlookers raised their eyebrows at Hendricks. He raised one back. "What? I've attended a few cross-discipline seminars."

"Yes, well, the Old French ritual burned with the Plutonic Codex back in 2015." Sinclair knelt by the ritual sign and frowned. "Just manage it the best you can."

Johnathan West looked towards the crowd; Harold stepped forward, holding out a large lampshade.

"Don’t call me Shirley." Johnathan chuckled at his own joke, and took the lampshade. "In all seriousness, we need to, essentially, get rid of the anti-climax by looking at it really, really hard and pointing out why it's awful."

"And the lampshade helps that how?" Hendricks frowned, crossing his arms.

Tristan took the lampshade and put the narrow end to his mouth, like a megaphone. "The louder you point it out, the more effective it is!" He put the shade down. "It was the closest thing on hand when we started the tests. It kind of became a tradition."

Hendricks rolled his eyes, and began reading off the incantation. Sinclair knelt by the seal, making sure the ritual remained stable, while Pike, West, and Bailey all began a very conspicuous discussion.

"Boy, that was an awful piece of writing!" Bailey bellowed through the lampshade. "Poor Hendricks never catches a break. Why do you always gotta pick on him, narrative?"

"Yeah! He deserves better," Pike agreed. "He's been the butt of jokes around the site ever since he ate that stupid hallucinogen! It's not fair!"

"Stop picking on Jason Hendricks for the sake of creating conflict! It's gotten old!" West pointed out, shouting it through the lampshade. "You've turned his life into a cliche!"

"And anticlimaxes aren't fun! He should have creamed us in that poker game!" Pike chimed in.

Hendricks wasn't sure how to react; on the one hand, they were supporting him, but on the other, they were doing it solely for the purposes of heckling a universal constant. He just kept reading.

"Well, for this spell to work, the target of the spell has to feel pain. For it to feel pain, it needs to be able to interpret that sensation as pain. For it to do that…"

"It… has to be sentient." West looked at the floating words as they started to dissipate. "Holy shit. Do you realize what this means?!"

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Archon1

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is currently being monitored within Nexus-18 (Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin) by researchers at Site-87's newly-founded pataphysics department.

In the event of a major SCP-001-X manifestation, Procedure 001-Pickman-β is to be carried out, as detailed in the file below. Any and all SCP-001-A techniques are allowed to be used in order to combat the spread of SCP-001-X.

Testing done with SCP-001 is to be carried out only with permission from Dr. Johnathan West.

Description: SCP-001 is a sentient, possibly sapient, universal constant first discovered by Foundation Archivist Isaiah Howard Pickman (1979-2017), and first described by Pike, West, Bailey, Sinclair et al in 2018. SCP-001 manifests itself as a force described as "Narrative Causality", wherein patterns observed in nature, history, technology, and anomalous phenomena and items conform to patterns observed in fictional narratives. This, combined with phenomena reported in S. Andrew Swann's SCP-001 proposal, has definitively proved that the baseline universe is at least partly fictional.

SCP-001-A refers to narrative exploitation techniques that can be used to manipulate SCP-001, and conceivably any other narrative construct. SCP-001-A techniques include:

Invoking an ironic reaction by stating a phrase such as "What could possibly go wrong?"
Creating a solution to a problem by uttering a phrase such as "We're missing something, but what?", or by several people turning to look at a single individual who they believe is capable of solving this problem.
Preventing disasters via awareness of the presence of certain phrases in conversation (i.e. "It's been boring lately" or "nothing ever happens here") or narrative patterns
Minor probability manipulation using mass encouragement or belief.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""
SCP-001-A techniques are not infallible; SCP-001 seems to be able to choose which techniques are capable of working at a given time.

SCP-001-X refers to malignant pieces of narrative causality, either manifesting naturally as a result of an unsatisfying narrative event or created by excessive use of SCP-001-A. SCP-001-X instances are detrimental to the narrative around it, and have the potential to create massive flaws in reality that cause mass confusion, the manifestation of powerful and nonsensical entities and abilities, and an overall degradation in the surrounding consensus reality.

SCP-001-X can be counteracted by use of a specific SCP-001-A technique, SCP-001-Pickman-β. SCP-001-Pickman-β is a procedure which involves the following steps:

Location: Use of a Pickman-Sinclair Narrative Fluctuation Detector to locate a pocket of SCP-001-X.
Isolation: Creating an area of stable SCP-001 around the SCP-001-X instance through use of narrative manipulation techniques such as gathering a large crowd of people to observe the process being undertaken.
Ridicule: The pocket of SCP-001-X is ridiculed by vocalizing observations regarding the nonsensical nature of how it manifested, and how SCP-001 should have occurred in absence of the SCP-001-X instance. It has been observed that ridiculing SCP-001-X instances at higher volumes is more effective.
Neutralization: After approximately five minutes, smaller SCP-001-X instances can be neutralized; larger SCP-001-X instances can take up to half an hour or longer to completely render inert.
Neutralization of SCP-001-X instances causes a pain response in SCP-001; this discovery has led to the conclusion that SCP-001 possesses some degree of sentience.

Discovery: SCP-001 was first observed in Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin (known as Nx-18 within the Foundation), an anomalous Nexus monitored by Site-87.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Isaiah Howard Pickman, an archivist at Site-87, observed several patterns of narrative causality within Sloth's Pit, and cataloged them over the course of fifteen years.

When his work was discovered posthumously in December 2017 by Dr. Cassandra Pike, she began attempting to corroborate his findings, which largely revolved around the manifestation of quasi-fictional entities in town being preceded or triggered by events which followed narrative conventions.

Dr. Tristan Bailey, a member of the Department of Multi-Universal Affairs, corroborated Pickman and Pike's findings with records of fluctuations in local reality compiled over the course of thirty years. With the aid of Dr. Katherine Sinclair, a thaumatologist, and Dr. Johnathan West, an anomalous item researcher, they were able to re-create the scenarios outlined by Pickman and create a device to detect changes in SCP-001, tentatively dubbed the Pickman-Sinclair Narrative Fluctuation Detector.

        await ctx.channel.send(""" Esoteric Containment Systems shall be used as a secondary precaution.

The current administration affirms, and mandates, the continuation of Project Palisade regardless of potential cost or consequence.

Standard Operating Procedure for Project Palisade:

(1) The Altis Engine is used to create a "cluster" of mirror timelines, which are defined as artificial timelines constructed by the Prime Foundation solely for Project Palisade.

(2) Mirror timelines are altered, using controlled CK-class Restructuring events and direct insertion of agents via inter-dimensional travel to desired points in history.

(3) Mirror timelines are monitored and reality structural integrity analyzed.

(4) Timelines with a high integrity level are selected for continued study. Timelines with a poor integrity level are designated as shield timelines.

(5) Proxy agents attract The Threat to a shield timeline, commonly performing anomalous "rituals" developed by Esoteric Containment Systems in order to ensure targeting by The Threat.

Note: As direct travel to shield timelines is necessary for the process, proxy "collaborator" agents are utilized (occasionally with a small number of mainline Foundation agents as oversight). Proxy agents are all "mirrors", typically corresponding Foundation personnel taken from mirror timelines. In exchange, their home timelines are protected from The Threat, as long as cooperation lasts.

(6) Vectors are gathered and distributed to chosen neighboring timelines.

Note: Vectors are elements from the initial shield timeline, such as a person, animal, or object, which have served as foci of ritual energy. The effect of using vectors is to draw The Threat to many timelines at once, making the attraction process significantly more efficient.

Current standard element is soil from the initial shield timeline (representing "gravedirt"), a highly successful suggestion by a collaborating "mirror" instance of the POI "The Black Queen".""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

(7) All shield timelines are evacuated by any mainline Foundation agents and (when feasible) proxy agents, and monitored until destroyed by The Threat.

This process is continually repeated to ensure The Threat is indefinitely kept away from mainline reality.

Description: SCP-001, also known as Project Palisade, is a method of protecting reality from ongoing existential threats.

Personnel create mirror timelines, alter them to discover methods of defeating threats, and ultimately divert the largest threats (especially the primary threat referred to as "The Threat" and/or "THE WORM") to destroy these mirror timelines instead of mainline reality.

Every other timeline in which the Foundation exists was created by Project Palisade.2

Project Palisade Precursors
Project Palisade originated from several anomaly-engineering projects created in [DATA EXPUNGED], notably Altis, First Strike, and Forward Insight.

ALTIS

"Altis" Project Report:

Project Codename: Altis

Project#: PRJALT-██████

Project Aims: To successfully create a Multiversal Creation Engine through the use of anomalous engineering, and use it to the benefit of the Foundation.

Project Description: Project Altis is the century-long engineering and development of a "Multiversal Creation Engine," which allows the Foundation to create artificial realities adjacent to the mainline reality. The Altis Engine is capable of creating a potentially infinite number of said mirror timelines.

Originally, Project Altis was intended to create "mirror" Foundations to aid the Foundation of mainline reality. "Mirror" Foundations were to be faced with various challenges that might grant insight to mainline reality, and successful mirror Foundations would then be visited by mainline Foundation agents and an organizational connection established. Ultimately, many mirror Foundations would assist mainline reality in defending against existential threats from the outside.""")

These aspects of Project Altis were permanently shelved, due to the lack of direct use against THE WORM. The Altis Engine is now almost exclusively used under the banner of Project Palisade.

FIRST STRIKE

"First Strike" Project Report:

Project Codename: First Strike

Project#: PRJFRS-██████

Project Aims: To successfully create a military-grade anomalous weaponry stockpile for use against foreign agents.

Project Description: Project has been permanently suspended. Project was previously approved (along with numerous similar programs) due to fears of potential open anomalous warfare, and the push from the "military wing" of Foundation leadership for active research on direct offensive and defensive capabilities of anomalous weaponry. The project resulted in the discovery of THE WORM.

Director Johnson: Honestly, even at the time, First Strike wasn't anything to write home about. Stockpiling anomalous weaponry? Please. We'd mastered 914, and we were already cracking [DATA EXPUNGED] But First Strike was General Bowe's pet project of the month. You know what that meant.

Interviewer: Remind me, if you don't mind?

Director Johnson: Access to any SCP you could think of. We started with the old man's favorites, of course. Early numbers only — an ego thing, you know how these generals were. Cross-testing was the rage at the time — some of the generals felt we weren't progressing fast enough with individual research projects, and we could learn more faster by knocking anomalies in to each other, like my daughter making her dolls kiss.""")

Director Johnson pauses.

Director Johnson: At any rate, I don't think any of that matters now. That kind of crazy-go-nuts crosstesting doesn't happen anymore — I think because someone up in Overwatch noticed that the really stable mirror realities typically aren't smashing together literally every anomaly under the sun until their universe implodes in a ball of stupid. How about that, huh? Eh, don't log that either. [REDACTED] will get pissed at me for spreading unpopular opinions.

Interviewer makes noncommittal gesture.

Director Johnson: The real reason First Strike changed everything is because, thanks to Bowe, we got to test anomalous weapons in neighboring realities. Y'know, the neighboring realities we used to have. You — you've got your report right there, right? Gamma-Aleph-6 and… Epsilon-Samekh-4, right?

Interviewer: That's correct.

Director Johnson nods.

Director Johnson: Epsilon-Samekh… that's the one that really went sideways. We were using that one to simulate defenses against extradimensional threats. The ultimate foreign agents, you know? Really lit a fire under generals of a certain kind, if you know what I mean. Bowe got us approval to build a test facility on Epsilon-Samekh, 'specially for extradimensional anomalies. That was the last thing he did for us before he got distracted by a newer, shinier object. I think it was trying to make a clone army out of 076 or something embarrassing like that. Maybe it's in your report?

Director Johnson takes a deep breath.

Director Johnson: We didn't get a whole hell of a lot done without Bowe greasing all the gears, but we still had plenty of crosstests to run. We were testing some godawful weapon we got from an SCP crosstest that'd be illegal now outside a mirror reality, and the team monitoring us started reporting some really strange readings.

Director Johnson pauses.

Interviewer: Strange in what way?

Director Johnson: Extradimensional contamination, they said. We didn't take it seriously at first. Didn't even stop testing. Then they kept calling us, over the course of the day, more and more panicked. By the end of the week our whole project was on hold. Reality dereification, they were calling it. The whole reality was coming apart under our noses, had been for months, and we'd only just noticed it. Imagine hearing about that — imagine you'd never heard of something like THE WORM — sorry, am I supposed to say that in a loud voice, now?

Interviewer: It's more a mental perception thing. We'll stylize it in all-caps in the log.

Director Johnson: Oh, uh. That's very kind of you, I guess. I was saying — we didn't know realities could fall apart at the time. Not literally. Metaphorically, sure, like we knew about the YK-class Vacuum Decay — or however they're classifying that now. We had protections against that, even by then. Laws of reality stop working — we make new laws. Whatever happened, we'd survive, even if humanity didn't. Reality failure — I think that's ZK-class — that was purely theoretical. Most of us didn't really believe it could happen. Funny, right?

Director Johnson: Kinda funny, right? Feeling that guilty over the death of one reality… and these days we go through mirror universes like toilet paper.4

Director Johnson pauses.

Director Johnson: Where was I? Right, the end of First Strike. After a month, they figured out what was going on. And we felt better, for a hot minute, until they told us the rest. The real truth was worse. If we'd been right, it would've just been the one reality gone. But the reality was falling apart at the seams because it was being eaten. Being destroyed. Whatever you want to call it. Being dereified by an outside force. The Threat. THE WORM.

[END LOG]

Incident Assessment RE: Reality Epsilon-Samekh-4 & Neighboring Realities (EXCERPT):

Investigation of extradimensional contamination in Reality Epsilon-Samekh-4 revealed the source to be numerous tears in the base spacetime matrix of the reality. Each tear was growing larger at an exponential rate.

Attempts to close these tears were abandoned due to the accelerating rate of both tear formation and cross-reality contamination. Reality Epsilon-Samekh-4 was sealed after an emergency order, resulting in the loss of several contaminated personnel.

Approximately 4 days following the sealing of Reality Epsilon-Samekh-4, the entire reality abruptly vanished from all extradimensional sensory arrays.

Assessment team initially considered this an isolated incident caused by an unknown anomalous force. Then, as previously reported, a similar pattern of events was repeated in Reality Gamma-Aleph-6, followed by 7 other adjacent realities under observation (see addenda).""")

Effects are so far inconsistent with known phenomena or SCP objects. However, during the destruction of Reality Gamma-Aleph-6, embedded wave detectors managed to record the advance waves caused by an unknown inbound entity. Shortly after, all detectors in Reality Gamma-Aleph-6 simultaneously failed.

Wave profile composites constructed from the incident indicated a >99% probability of a singular entity, with activity patterns consistent with directed movement as opposed to random chance.

Assessment team concluded that this entity was responsible for the destruction of Reality Gamma-Aleph-6 and neighboring realities.

"Forward Insight" Project Report:

Project Codename: Forward Insight

Project#: PRJFOI-██████

Project Aims: To successfully ascertain the nature of the threat responsible for recent destruction of neighboring realities, and assess current and future danger to the Foundation and mainline reality.

Project Description: Project is ongoing, attempting to further assess The Threat.

Starting from data collected by early assessment teams, research team combined the Heisenberg-Reimann model with ongoing esoteric reality monitoring systems to analyze the pattern of reality disappearances. Results indicated a high likelihood of mainline reality being a victim of reality dereification within the next fifteen (15) years.

Oracular information was authorized to ascertain exactly when mainline reality would likely be affected, which eventually occurred on ██/██/████, less than one (1) month before predicted end-of-reality scenario.

Project Palisade was created in response to Forward Insight's initial report.

Project Description: On ██/██/19██, a vote of the O5 Council merged all personnel belonging to Project First Strike, Project Forward Insight, and 17 other Projects under a new singular directive code-named Project Palisade.

Palisade esoteric containment specialists were unable to identify any way of directly containing THE WORM. However, they discovered methods of attracting THE WORM to specific timelines, using world-altering ritualistic techniques incorporating heavy technological and anomalous aspects.

After debate lasting █ years, a vote of the O5 Council approved use of the Altis Engine to create sacrificial timelines to stop THE WORM.

The foundations of extradimensional invasion strategy developed under First Strike, combined with the intelligence provided by Forward Insight, were further expanded in order to create methods of preparing candidate timelines for insertion of Foundation assets and ritual manifestation.

Palisade was implemented on an emergency basis with Iteration "X".

The Threat
Recovered Documentation: Project Forward Insight, in its early stages, expanded investigation of The Threat into existing Foundation archives. It was discovered that several documents in the Foundation’s possession, collected from across multiple realities, contained previously unrecognized references to the entity identified as being responsible for the ongoing reality destruction. The current designation of the entity as "THE WORM" arises from these documents.

However, other mistakes in the canon have been discovered before, and it is certainly possible that Mardrash erred.

Object Class: Keter5

Special Containment Procedures: Ongoing containment by use of Project Palisade.

Description: Formerly code-named Primary Existential Threat Alpha. Renamed by O5 Council vote to "THE WORM"6, based on a selection of recommendations provided by Esoteric Containment Systems.

"THE WORM" (henceforth referred to as The Threat) is an extra-dimensional entity that destroys realities/timelines.7 Little other information is known; even the "extra-dimensional" description is technically in doubt.

The Threat has never been directly perceived by any means. However, its effects are well-documented, thanks to Project Palisade. Every affected timeline goes through various stages of "reality breakdown", with symptoms ranging from disappearance of physical locales to disappearance of various laws of physics. Finally, the timeline disintegrates entirely.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

At present, no mechanism has been detected or analyzed by which The Threat causes these effects, and The Threat has never been directly perceived by any means.

Esoteric information-gathering (notably from mirror timelines) has suggested that The Threat will only destroy or consume timelines which exhibit poor structural integrity. At the very least, The Threat seems to avoid timelines with good structural integrity, barring outside intervention.

Though case-by-case success rate is variable, Project Palisade procedures have so far had a 100% success rate in keeping The Threat away from mainline reality.8

"The Threat" is usually called "THE WORM" outside this documentation.9 Esoteric Containment Systems suggests that "THE WORM" is appropriate terminology for the following reasons:

The term is one of a selection of terms with cross-dimensional "psychic resonance", appearing directly or obliquely in mythos from neighboring realities assessed by Project Forward Insight.
A worm is popularly perceived to be a creature inferior to humans, which grants a different form of "psychic resonance" that may aid in reality-wide perspective shift, potentially allowing it to eventually be better understood by human minds.10
The stylization "THE WORM" is based on the recommendation that The Threat should be both undercut and also treated as important enough to devote primary organizational resources.
"The Threat" is also accepted terminology, as the term is already too established to completely remove.11 Mainline Foundation agents should consider either "The Threat" or "THE WORM" required terminology as part of Esoteric Containment Systems.

The Foundation has no other way to control The Threat besides Project Palisade. Uncontrolled, The Threat will eventually destroy most or all of the timelines created by Project Palisade, and then reach and destroy mainline reality.""")

Project Palisade Mechanics

STANDEREDS

Timeline Alteration Standards:

Timelines created by the Altis Engine for Project Palisade currently always possess these traits:

Begins as a duplicate of mainline reality, before alteration.
SCP items and other anomalous items are always present, even if believed otherwise.
Known civilization never has the capability of creating an exact copy of Project Altis. In specific cases, civilizations are allowed to create anomalies similar to Project Altis, but capabilities are always altered to protect mainline reality (even if this alteration is not known to the mirror civilization).
Inhabitants of the mirror timeline are never able to access mainline reality.
Note: This protection has occasionally failed. Some notable exceptions:

Entity classified as SCP-3812 in originating timeline. Humanoid with the ability to ascend upward through "levels" of reality. Passed through with no effect on mainline reality.
Entity commonly classified as SCP-1985 in many timelines. A humanoid apocalypse exploration device. Instance's originating timeline not yet located. Instance entered mainline reality, presumably investigating an unknown apocalypse affecting mainline reality (possibly "THE WORM"). Unfortunately, personnel were not properly briefed on handling such a circumstance, and delivered ill-advised explicit threats. SCP-1985 instance reacted negatively, and retreated from mainline reality through self-termination before apprehension could occur. Mechanism of accessing mainline reality unclear, but appears to have been accidental. SCP-1985 instance did not appear to realize significance of discovery in any way.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""
Entities appearing to be mirrors of standard Foundation team used to carry out [DATA EXPUNGED]
Created timelines usually possess these traits:

The Foundation usually exists in timeline's modern period, except in specific test cases focusing on SCP items, GOIs, etc.
The Foundation usually has existed since at least the 1980s, most commonly since at least the 1950's, and often since at least the late 1800's.
The Foundation is usually a significant player in Earth's civilization.
SCP-173 usually exists and is contained by the Foundation, and classified using database number 173, except in specific test cases.
SCP-classified items usually number in the thousands, with trivial anomalous items existing in numbers too high to count. (Initial test runs limited number of SCP items, but the limit has gradually been raised as more stable mirror timelines have been successfully created.)
Typical SCP-classified items are usually horrifying in nature (reflecting mainline reality), though many exceptions usually exist (and may often technically outnumber the SCP items perceived as horrifying in nature).
World-ending threats are usually present, but usually in forms which the Foundation is theoretically able to at least temporarily contain (or survive without containing for a significant observation period).
SCP database entries usually work like mainline reality, except that gaps are present. Gaps correspond to SCP items not present in that timeline. Local mirror Foundation agents always explain the missing items in a way that makes sense to themselves (typically that the slot is waiting to be filled, or theoretically exists but has all access denied). This alteration is for ease of monitoring.
Common exceptions to this rule include SCP-001, SCP-1000, SCP-2000, SCP-3000, SCP-4000, and other SCP-_000 database entries. Outside of early test runs (some of which classified a "Bipolar Guitar" as SCP-1000), these system slots have been used for "key variant" experimentation.""")

Anomalous "Groups of Interest" usually exist and are relevant, at least to the Foundation.

CREATION

Transcript of Timeline Orientation Lecture: Delivered on ██/██/2018 by Dr. ███████14.

Excerpt 1: Timeline Creation

…The Altis Engine mimics what may well be the "natural" method of timeline creation. Which is to say, you never get one timeline. You get "clusters".

A "cluster" of timelines always has either low variance, or high interconnectivity, or rarely, both. What's that mean?

Low variance means you have many parallel "mirror universes". You know, Star Trek style — does that reference date me? You know, when the heroes jump to another timeline and find themselves, but evil, and wearing goatees. Sometimes there's even less variance than that — a genetic quirk makes being left-handed more common than right-handed, or Independence Day is a day later than another reality. Sometimes there's no visible variance at all.

High interconnectivity simply means that the timelines are highly connected, through short-range interdimensional travel. Probably the most common type we've seen are so-called "Ways", often accessed through a Wanderers' Library).

As you know, we, the original Foundation, are unique across all timelines, as confirmed by Project Altis.15 But we exist in a cluster, too. We used to visit neighboring realities quite often, in fact — we being the Foundation, of course. No, you didn't miss a CK-class event. Little joke, there.

As I was saying, mainline reality is part of a cluster. It's just that most of our cluster was destroyed by THE WORM before we created the Palisade.

Our cluster is high variance — humanity didn't even exist in most of our former neighbors, and when they did, history was very different.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Our cluster makes up for that with high interconnectivity. You can see this with the numerous anomalous gateways we've contained, such as SCP-004). Maybe someday we'll point THE WORM there too, eh? No great loss. Another little joke.16 Tough crowd.

INTEGRITY

Transcript of Timeline Orientation Lecture: Delivered on ██/██/2018 by Dr. ███████.

Excerpt 2: Reality Integrity Theory

…I'll admit, the science behind reality integrity theory is a little backwards. There's a lot of anomalous assessment in there that we don't quite understand yet. That said, so far it's been far and away the best way to understand how THE WORM targets timelines.

What was that? Yes, timelines or realities. Those terms are interchangeable for our purposes, take note. We usually say "reality" to describe mainline reality or other non-artificial realities, and "timeline" to describe mirror timelines created by the Altis Engine. That's informal, though. I'm gonna stick with realities for now, if that's helpful.

The reality integrity paradigm is, obviously, a comparison to architectural integrity. Like how earthquakes won't knock down earthquake-proofed buildings.

Unlike buildings, though, we don't yet know what makes a reality's structural integrity stronger or weaker. For all we know, the paradigm implied by the words "structural integrity" may eventually prove inaccurate — maybe one of you will be the one to give us a better paradigm!

For now, though, this is the only paradigm backed up by evidence, even if we got that evidence through anomalous means.

We also don't know what causes a reality to change structural integrity. We only know that it happens.

Changes to events in a reality's timeline — such as those produced by a CK-class restructuring event — may significantly increase or decrease a reality's structural integrity. That's how Palisade usually alters timelines, plus good old-fashioned time travel. Which alters structural integrity too, by the way.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

But you don't actually need anything so drastic. Usually, a reality's structural integrity — and its vulnerability to THE WORM — increases or decreases by the simple passage of time.

And, yes, we've reached the elephant in the room. At the start of Project Palisade, we assessed our reality. And you know what we found. Mainline reality's structural integrity is of… extremely poor quality. And no one, anywhere, knows why.17

Our reality integrity has changed since we started Project Palisade. To what, I don't know. That's classified Level 5. O5 only, or whoever else they grant special access to. Doesn't include me — more's the pity. I only know it's changed, and changed a lot. Why? Your guess is as good as mine.

But the last thing I can tell you is that in the vast majority of cases Foundation intervention in a timeline results in a decaying reality integrity level. We really have no idea why this is — especially because Foundation intervention has also sometimes resulted in incredibly strong reality integrity levels. Food for thought. Maybe some of you will figure this one out, too.18

Oh, good question! So far, several thousand mirror realities created by Project Palisade are considered "stable", with a structural integrity sufficient to likely protect them from The Threat, unless mainline Foundation artificially draws it there. That hasn't happened anytime recently, at least — higher-ups would get really mad. If it's been done before, I don't have access to that information. Yes, it would be an interesting experiment, of course.

That's correct. We can't simply have humanity migrate to another reality because that would be an act of major interference, which may change that reality's integrity for the worse. For all we know, it could paint a huge target on our backs. Believe me, we thought about that first.

This is where I should point else something out.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" All mirror realities created by Project Palisade are officially considered subordinate to mainline reality, whatever their structural integrity. If necessary, we'll make use of them in… whatever way is appropriate. That's what they were made for. If you'll pardon me getting philosophical here for a moment, it's their ultimate fate. Written in the very fabric of their many universes. Even the strong ones.19

How many mirror realities have been destroyed? Hell, I don't know the number. You know what they say — how many drops of water are in the ocean?

Project Palisade Timeline

ITERATION X

05/██/2007: Project Palisade put into action on an emergency basis with Iteration X, referring to a universal database system co-opted for Palisade use. Item # SCP-173 is chosen as the baseline for the first test runs.

The first test run is extremely successful, creating many timelines which are destroyed by THE WORM, drawing it away from mainline reality, and buying time to create reliable attraction methods.

This first test run also creates a number of timelines which THE WORM avoids, and which are still in existence today, with high reality integrity scores.

██/██/2007: As Iteration X progresses, numerous mirror Foundation instances are "encouraged" to adopt anomalous weaponry programs. Most of these instances become failed timelines (and are internally controversial), but many successes also result, particularly those centered around key variant "Mobile Task Force Omega-7".

Additionally, numerous key variant Foundation personnel are established. Some key variants are mirrors of existing mainline Foundation personnel, and others only exist in mirror timelines. Notable early key variants include personnel code-named "Gears", "Kain Pathos Crow", and "Bantay Masipag".

After mass Foundation fatalities on excursions to mirror universes (fortunately largely reversed through technology gleaned from other mirrors), preliminary recruitment of extra-universal assets commences.""")

ITERATION E

01/19/2008: Iteration X officially considered a success and resolved. Analysis of Iteration X timelines shows that most mirror timelines created were failed, exhibiting extremely poor structural integrity. (This would ultimately be the case for every Iteration.) This was ultimately seen as a positive outcome, given that many mirrors now existed redirect THE WORM to, and that a minority of mirrors were likely not vulnerable to THE WORM, presenting opportunities for long-term study.

Iteration X analysis also reveals that most mirror timelines exhibit hostile environments, and humans (where present) exhibit irrational and violent behavior. Additionally, numerous reality clusters vanished without trace or explanation (perhaps targeted by THE WORM, perhaps not). Reality creation procedures updated accordingly with move to Iteration E.

Post-analysis, Project Palisade moves to Iteration E, referring to a universal database system with updated capability, code-named "████████".

Iteration E used multiple "baseline" key variants in addition to SCP-173, notably SCP-529. Mirror timeline creation rate gradually increased.

ITERATION W

07/19/2008: Iteration E is successfully resolved. Project Palisade moves to Iteration W, referring to a new universal database system code-named "███████". Creation of mirror timelines increased exponentially.

Timeline destruction rituals are now standardized, approved by majority vote of assigned council. Module may be accessed within the Foundation system archive itself, by assigned council only.

As of current file update (09/03/2018), Iteration W is the current iteration.

07/26/2008: Any "key variant" SCP item with central significance to Project Palisade is now recorded as SCP-001, beginning with item code-named "Sheaf of Papers", along with oldest entry in the pre-SCP classification system, Item #86243AR-001.""")

05/01/2009: As Iteration W stabilizes, O5 Command fully takes on all assignments and guidelines related to Project Palisade. Communications are handled via newly created central access hubs.

12/04/2009: Project Palisade variant creation resumes.

07/27/2011: With nearly 1000 SCPs in common use as "variants" in creation of mirror timelines, it is established that in addition to SCP-001 "key variants", new major "key variants" shall be chosen and assigned to specific 4-digit system slots (1000, 2000, 3000, etc).

02/25/2013: Mirror timeline creation expanded to focus on "canons" with no single SCP item as a "key variant". "Canons" exhibit a high degree of variance for increased testing value.

05/27/2014: Mirror timeline creation further expanded to focus on items held (or assessed) by anomalous Groups of Interest as "key variants".

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is to be confined to a specially modified containment facility that is to appear similar to other Foundation Sites. The main differences between this facility and existing Sites are that it is to be outfitted with living arrangements for the entire Overseer Council. This is to disguise the nature of SCP-001's containment. Additionally, all rooms1 in the facility are to be equipped with security cameras. It is also to be equipped with three failsafe nuclear warheads which shall be detonated should SCP-001 breach containment. This site is to be named Site-01.

One member of the O5 Council is to partake in a regimen involving mnestic drugs. The individual undergoing the regimen (henceforth referred to as the Archivist) is to maintain a journal of all information gathered about SCP-001, as well as any events of note involving SCP-001. At the end of an individual's tenure as Archivist, they are to convene a special O5 meeting to assess the state of SCP-001's containment and update this file. Tenures will last at most four months at a time, however, an Archivist may resign sooner should the mnestic regimen's side-effects grow too intense.

As of this writing, the only O5 members with proper tolerance to mnestic drugs to take on the role of the Archivist are O5-1, O5-8 and O5-12.

No member of the O5 Council (including SCP-001) is permitted to leave Site-01 without an approved accompaniment from MTF Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand"). Access to this document is to be restricted to non-anomalous members of the O5 Council and safeguarded with a memetic kill agent.

Description: SCP-001 is the entity known as O5-13. The exact nature of SCP-001 is not yet known. How SCP-001 came to be in the position of O5-13 is still under investigation. Due to the current lack of understanding of SCP-001, it has been deemed necessary to keep SCP-001 unaware of its containment.""")

SCP-001 is known to take on the appearance of a 1.9m tall male human of Latin American descent. Whether or not this is SCP-001's true form or a disguise is still under investigation.

SCP-001 was classified as anomalous following the Caesar Incident. While details of the Caesar Incident are under investigation by the O5 Council, the following events are understood to be the result of the Caesar Incident:

The death of all previous O5 Council members, except for O5-13.
The destruction of the previous Site-01.
The loss of all documentation regarding SCP-001 prior to the Caesar Incident, had such documentation existed.
It is also understood that SCP-001 caused the Caesar Incident through manifestation of its anomalous properties. Due to the lack of information about the Caesar event, it is currently believed that one of these properties is antimemetic in nature, although this has not yet been confirmed.

As of this writing, the investigation of SCP-001 has been delegated as follows:

Opening Remarks by O5-1:

O5-1: Hello everyone. I'm sure you're all wondering why Thirteen isn't here today. I'll get to that, but first I want to publicly address something I'm sure you've all noticed by now. After talking to you for the past week or so, I've noticed that we've all been inducted onto the Council almost at the exact same time. All of us, except Thirteen that is. In fact, Thirteen probably conducted your orientation.

Council members nod.

O5-2: It's good to know that wasn't just me. I would've expected the last Two to run me through things.

O5-1: Indeed. In fact, I asked Thirteen about it, but he refused to say much. Of course he pled ignorance, but I don't believe that.""")

O5-6: You got in contact with him?

O5-11: I thought he was entirely off the grid. Either that or just fake.

O5-1: I spoke to the previous One a while back. He mentioned something about a wish list he wanted to send to the Administrator. I did a little digging, sent a letter to the north pole, and got a response.

O5-4: I have a hard time believing that's all it takes.

O5-1: You're right, there's more to it than that, but I'd rather discuss the process another time. But back to his response: as you might guess, the previous twelve O5s did not retire at the same time. They were killed. In fact, this building isn't even the original Site-01. That was destroyed. I think you can see where this is going.

O5-3: So, we have a dead O5 council, a missing Site-01, and somehow none of this is on our records.

O5-2: And only one suspect.

O5-1: I would like to designate O5-13 as one of our SCP-001 projects. Of course, this will be kept secret from him, but we need to investigate this entire ordeal until we figure out what happened, how it happened, and why O5-13 is the only one left standing.

Caesar Incident Update: Due to the lack of information about Site-01, including its geographical location, there has been difficulty in establishing who, if anyone, survived the incident. A number of personnel who transferred into their current department during the week following the Caesar Incident were interviewed, as it was believed that these individuals had originally worked at Site-01.

Preface: The following interview was conducted over a secure telephone line. The interviewer used standard voice modulation to deter probability of being properly identified. The interviewee was not informed of the identity of the interviewer.

Interviewee: Dr. Henry Pollick

Pollick: Hello?

Pollick: Sorry, uh… not sure I remember all that well. It was a few months back and all.

O5-2: I would think it'd stand out. It was just before your transfer.

Pollick: Oh shit right! Yeah yeah…

O5-2: You remember why you got transferred?

Pollick: Yeah. Containment breach went off at my old site. Really fucked me up bad, but I don't know many of the details. They're probably classified and all that.

O5-2: You know what Site you were working at?

Pollick: Site-5.2

O5-2: Alright. Well, do you remember anything else about the breach?

Pollick: Sorry but I don't think so. Probably had something antimemetic in it that got to me. Either that or I'm just blocking it out.

O5-4: Ten…

O5-10: … still contains a section for O5-13. I could not discern if it has been tampered with, since the edit history has been erased.

O5-4: Or Thirteen wanted to hide something about the other O5 members.

O5-1 Statement on Previous Council: O5-1 recorded in the Archivist Journal, and discussed with the O5 Council his interaction with the previous O5-1. Below is an excerpt from the Conference Transcript:

O5-11: We can't make any assumptions about the previous council. We don't know what they did and not understand about Thirteen. Hell, every message I got from them was sent through an intermediary. Even the emails.

O5-6: Actually, I believe One has spoken to some of the previous council in person.

All members turn to O5-1.

O5-1: This is true. However, I only spoke with the previous O5-1 once.

O5-11: What about?

O5-1: It was after my promotion to Site Director. The initial briefing is usually delivered by the previous Director but… well he was killed during a containment breach, which was the reason for my promotion. O5-1 elected to brief me instead.

O5-6: So you discussed mostly Site-23 specific details?

O5-1: Mostly. He asked me at the beginning something peculiar though. He said, "What shit hole are you escaping from that makes this hellscape of a job worth taking?" I asked him to clarify and he responded, "I guess we're all fucked up differently. I'm fucked up from the neck down. You're just fucked in the head." He went on about modifications that had been made to his body to increase longevity. After that, we talked about philosophies regarding how containment of anomalies should be handled, which circled back around to briefing me on Site-23.

O5-11: So he didn't say anything about Thirteen then.

O5-1: He did not, but I didn't sense any sort of unease when he spoke of his fellow council members. But then again this might have been before the current Thirteen's appointment, it was nine years ago.""")

Notice from O5-8
Conference #3 was cut short after an intense exchange led to enough people leaving the meeting for us to lose quorum. We archived all of the material covered up to that point, as well as the efforts made to de-escalate tension between the members. However, this also means that information herein was not properly vetted by the entire Council before being uploaded, so we erred on the conservative side. If you need to see the full proceedings, please contact the current Archivist.

Caesar Incident Update:

Investigation of Previous Site-01 Report
Location: The geographical location of the previous Site-01 (henceforth referred to as Site-01-P for the purposes of this report) is not recorded anywhere within the Foundation Database. Therefore, we expanded our search to see if any unexplained phenomena occurred on May 13th that might have originated from the Caesar Incident. While the majority of oddities that occurred on that day could be attributed to a known anomaly, one incident could not be explained.

An earthquake measuring 6.6 on the Richter Scale originated from an uninhabited island off the coast of Greenland. Greenland is known to have glacial earthquakes, but those generally register around 5.5 on the Richter Scale and occur more often in the summer. An aerial inspection of the island revealed that this was, in fact, the location of Site-01-P.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Exploration: Aerial photographs of the area surrounding Site-01-P shown that it had been completely decimated. Almost none of the original structure was intact.

Additionally, measurements taken by the same aircraft discovered that the area emitted radiation at levels similar to that of nuclear fallout sites. Between this, and the site of the explosion as indicated by the Richter Scale measurement, it appears that Site-01-P detonated its on-site nuclear warhead as part of the Caesar Incident.

A team of four agents was selected to explore the wreckage of Site-01-P. This team was equipped with Hazmat Suits, SCRAMBLE gear, and a number of measurement devices. Unfortunately, the team could not reach the site, as after they landed on the island, the team was approached by GOC representatives demanding they vacate the premises. The GOC had set up a hidden outpost on the island that did not appear in earlier photographs.

Further investigation revealed that the only O5 member who was previously contacted about the GOC taking control of the area surrounding Site-01-P was O5-13. This has not been brought to O5-13's attention for fear of raising suspicion of our investigation.

Origin Update: The Origins Investigation team attempted to retrieve information pertaining to SCP-001 from Groups of Interest, since Foundation databases have been tampered with. Below is a summary of their results:

Group Of Interest: Global Occult Coalition

O5-4: Yes, that does make sense. I'm sorry, I did not write that section of the report.

O5-10: If my memory serves me well, Seven was responsible for the Marshall, Carter and Dark reconnaissance.

O5-1: Well, Seven, could you elaborate?

O5-7 looks at O5-1, and swallows.

O5-11: You know, the rules are pretty tight on this. Why did you give them anything in the first place?

O5-3: Eleven makes a good point. Don't we have our own spies working some of the transport routes?

O5-7 nods and then begins going through her belongings.

O5-3: Could you at least tell us what kind of information you gave them?

O5-7 pauses, thinks to herself for a moment and then motioned to the entire Council.

Update Regarding Information Security Concern:

Following the official ending of the meeting, O5-7 distributed the summary of all information exchanged with Marshall, Carter and Dark. The information was pulled from the out-of-date O5 Dossier. The current explanation as to why it was accepted by the Group of Interest is that it would have confirmed any information they had gathered previously about the O5 Council. As part of the exchange we have received a tip as to where to find more information on SCP-001, which the Origins Team will investigate for the next conference.

O5-7 later clarified in a written statement that she had left the meeting simply to retrieve the file detailing this information, since it was not on her person.""")

O5-12: Two, why doesn't your team start us off.

O5-2: Alright, sure. We did make some nice progress.

O5-8: Always good to start a meeting on a high note.

O5-2: You all remember those four survivors we talked about last meeting, right? We got back in touch with them and did a more… thorough interview. More intense techniques, lie detector tests, heart rate monitoring, the whole shebang.

O5-3: Do you have transcripts?

O5-2: I do but, spoiler-alert, they're not very different from the first round.

O5-9: So, we're now convinced they genuinely don't remember.

O5-11: How far does Thirteen's antimemetic side reach?

O5-2: Slow down there. We're not quite done. You see, as part of our second round of interviews, we also did a physical examination and some tests to see what messed with their heads. And we found they all had a little scar, right on the side of their necks. Right where we inject amnestics.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

O5-8: I mean, while I understand what you're implying, we tend to administer amnestics fairly liberally. Last meeting was essentially just a prolonged reminder of how much we value InfoSec.

O5-2: True, but we keep good records of who we use with that stuff, how much we're using, if we're using the pills or the syringe, etcetera. However when I went to look up if any of our "survivors" had ever taken the injectable amnestic, all my results came back negative.

O5-6: I also took the liberty of checking out Red Right Hand. The entire squad's got injection scars, and we rarely wipe those guys.

O5-2: Whatever happened… I think we covered it up ourselves.

O5-1: When you say "ourselves" do you mean—

O5-2: Oh, no I just mean the Foundation. If we were actually involved, then everyone here would have those scars, but Six, Nine and I definitely don't have them, so that leads me to believe they didn't drug us. It would be an all-or-nothing deal.

O5-12: Good work. Sounds like Eight needs to have a talk with our Amnestics Department.

O5-8: Wait, wait. Sorry, I'm still trying to keep all details in order. You said they were injected?

O5-2: Yeah.

O5-8: See, that's what I don't get. We used the injections like, ten years ago? We moved onto the pills since you can miss a vein. Also, I checked our amnestics supply right after the Caesar event, and we didn't see any variation from our normal usage.

O5-6: Maybe the records are off? We've found that whatever Thirteen did, he's good at covering up his tracks.

O5-8: I don't think that's it. Because you know who does still use those injectable amnestics? The GOC.

O5-12: I see we'll have to schedule another meeting with our good friends at the UN as well.

PoI-001: I could tell you, he came alone, but he didn't leave alone.

Tennison: What do you mean?

PoI-001: Bunch of guys came by, UIU I think? They came and picked him up. Surprised the hell out of both of us. Though I'm even more surprised I was able to get out of there.

Tennison: What did he look like?

Conference Transcript Excerpt

O5-3: Ok… so everyone here has the records of our measurements, although I can tell you now, they are not particularly insightful.

O5-10: Do you have too many leads to choose from?

O5-5: Quite the opposite actually. We have nothing. Nothing abnormal with regard to radiation, humes, radio frequencies. Thirteen is almost impressively normal.

O5-2: Are you sure we're not going about this wrong? I mean, I know we've kind of quantified some of our anomalies in the past but, as a general rule they're not supposed to follow the rules, right?

O5-3: That is what I was beginning to suspect, although it is troubling that he can just hide it from us entirely.

O5-5: Or there's the other option - we're not only barking up the wrong tree, but we're in the entirely wrong forest.

O5-4: You saying he's not even anomalous in the first place?

O5-3: It's either that, or we're dealing with a god. And a god who knows the Foundation better than even we do.

O5-1: Let's continue to discuss the non-anomalous option, since it appears that there would be very little we could do about the other case.

O5-9: So, that would mean that he's probably an inside man for the Insurgency.

O5-11: Or Serpent's Hand.

O5-3: No, not the hand. They don't operate like this.

O5-2: He might be a Fifthist fanatic.

O5-9: That too.

O5-1: Or maybe he's with someone else. We've seen quite a bit of the GOC and UIU popping up in this.

O5-10: My apologies, but I do find it difficult to believe that a single insurgent would be able to detonate the on-site nuclear warhead from half-way across the globe, if we believe our previous information.

O5-3: I'm not sure we can though. It sounds like he spoke to our regular body double.""")

O5-5: Maybe his anomalous property is that he can create body doubles?

O5-11: But what are we supposed to do with that?

O5-12: Excuse me, but I would like to return to the earlier line of discussion about Thirteen being unable to perform the assassination due to possibly meeting with our point of contact, because I am beginning to believe that he actually did meet with Thirteen.

O5-5: So, you believe that he was able to blow Site-01 sky high from halfway across the globe? I mean, if we're going with the god theory I could see it.

O5-12: No, I'm saying he had help. Or at least more than one man helping him. Remember how our request to install additional security cameras was denied by the Ethics Committee?

O5-6: Did you finally talk to them?

O5-12: I did. I met with Mr. Huang to demand an explanation. He refused and told me it was above my security clearance.

O5-11: Above your security clearance? You're on the Council, there simply aren't things "outside of your jurisdiction". You run the Ethics Committee for goodness sakes!

O5-12: That's not quite accurate. I am not in charge of the Ethics Committee, I'm simply the O5 ambassador to it. They need to be a separate entity to eliminate bias in various cases.

O5-1: So, you believe that Thirteen is in league with the Ethics Committee?

O5-3: Or the Administrator if it's set above your security clearance.

O5-12: Or both. Whoever it is, they are trying very hard to stop us from seeing him in private.

O5-11: Someone should just let us give him a full physical. He's probably baseline, this would let us confirm that.

O5-2: Yeah, but if we're wrong and our "god theory" is correct, he'll blow our asses sky-high like the last council.

O5-1: I believe that we need to adjourn here, so we have enough time to prepare for our next full Council meeting to avoid suspicion. Although we do need to expand our search further.""")

PLEASE ENTER SECURITY CREDENTIALS TO CONTINUE ************ ACCEPTED. Welcome O5-13. You have (1) Message

Hello Thirteen,

I’m sure you’ve been keeping tabs on your fellow Council’s progress. They’re growing closer than either of us wanted, but I’m not surprised. When you get enough smart people together, they tend to surpass your expectations.

You’re probably hoping this is going to end soon. I’m sorry you’ve gone through this, it obviously wasn’t in our plan for you when we inducted you into the council. But, if you could keep up our gambit a little longer I would be appreciative. I’m unconvinced your cohorts are ready to know what happened to their predecessors, and I don’t want to ask Al Fine and Johnson to help clean up another May 13th. I don't even want the thought of pulling a Caesar Event in their heads. The GOC and the UIU already have enough dangling over my head as is.

But if they do approach you, and confront you about the situation, I’d rather you have a direct answer. Also, transcripts tend to be more convincing than recall.

I’ve attached here the transcript from the O5 meeting before the "Caesar Incident". It’s part of the last-minute backup that Site-01 performed as part of Stage 3 Containment Breach Protocols. If anyone asks where those backups are stored, you can tell them the same thing I told you – it’s beyond their clearance.

O5-1: No, no. I’m accusing all of you of selling out, or being out for yourself or some shit. You’ve all gone soft. It used to be ”if it don’t make sense, throw it in a cage”.

Description: [DATA EXPUNGED]

You stare at the screen. Nothing? There's nothing. You scratch your thinning hair and click on different fragments of text and bits of source code. You squint your eyes and will the words to rearrange themselves. The results are the same with every attempt. The confidence you girded yourself with is broken. Your daring edifice crumbles.

Nothing. There's nothing here.

You take deep breaths. Not intentionally; you aren't self-aware enough to calm down. It feels like death is creeping up on you. Career death. Physical death. Death of everything left to you. So much for investigating workplace rumors. So much for one final indulgence before your life finishes its collapse.

Something twinges in the back of your brain. A remnant of the strange image you passed over moments ago. A remnant of the wall built around nothing at all.

Deep breaths.

"Emmet Petroskey?"

You turn, office chair groaning as you do. Two people wait at the entrance of your cubicle. Both in gray fatigues. Both armed. One, a towering bald man with a slight smile. It's surely at your expense. The other, a shorter woman with mud-colored hair and watery eyes.

"I'm Emmet."

"Sergeant Grauer, site security," says the man. He gestures to the badge pinned to his uniform.

"Special Agent Morgan, internal security," says the woman. She has no badge. "Come with us, please." Your heart thunders at her tone, and mucus drips down your throat.

Deeper breaths.

You had a plan for this. The magic words for every situation you've ever encountered in your long years at the Foundation. "You, uh, you've gotta talk to my supervis–"

"This doesn't need to be a scene," says Agent Morgan. She sounds ready to drag you down the hall by your feet. "Please come with us, Mr. Petroskey."

Deep breaths. Deep breaths.""")

You follow the pair of officers down the hallways of Site-02. People stare out here too. Everyone can tell you're not important enough to deserve an escort. Not for any good reason.

The site's main hallways form wide arteries, each splitting into narrow capillaries that wind deep into every crevice. You're led to a steel door set in a cinderblock wall. Grauer punches a code into it, one firm jab at a time. Your throat hurts as you watch him. Your lungs hurt. You feel like your body is strangling itself.

"This doesn't need to be a scene," repeats Morgan.

You're not religious, but you pray it doesn't become one.

Deepest breaths.

The room is tiny and sparse. A flickering light in the tiled ceiling. A stainless drain in the tiled floor. A narrow chair bolted down. You sit, and can feel the chill seeping through your suit. Your career must outstrip theirs by at least a decade, but you still feel like a child in detention when you look up.

"Full name, date of birth, and Foundation ID number?" asks Morgan while Grauer taps on a small tablet.

"Emmet Petroskey. February 9, 1981. And, uh, 542313. I think. My badge is up on my desk."

"Current position?"

"Intel analyst."

"Then you're aware that you were attempting to access classified information?"

"I was just following up on a rumor." You gulp, but the mucus feels like it's crawling higher and higher in your throat. "I was about to contact RAISA when you showed up. There's some kinda security gap on that entry."

"I see." Morgan and Grauer look at each other meaningfully. You can't hope to tell what is exchanged in that silence. "We'll be back."

You swallow as the two leave. Again, as the door slams shut. Again, as the silence sets in.

Your throat hurts.

Your body adjusts to the cold, but you shiver all the same. The chair was designed for discomfort.""")

Swallow hard.

Minutes pass. Hours pass. Surely, it's been hours. You give up on the chair and lean against a cold wall. The dripping above you has become irregular, and the sirens have stopped. Heavy footsteps sound out in the hall, first going to the right, then the left. You rub the rash that's been spreading down your arm all week.

Time passes. You can't say how much. The pipe drips. The sirens drone. Footsteps thud back and forth. Drip. Drone. Thud. You swallow hard and breathe harder. You sink down the wall to sit on the floor. It's even colder still.

After a small eternity, the door opens.

"What was the project in question?" asks Morgan.

"I was, uh, doing follow up for our 2025 report on securing internal file systems." Sweat beads under your arms. "You should know how important that it, right? It's critical."

"And you decided to pry into deeply classified information? You should know the importance of SCP-001."

"I can't count how many times you should have called them before you reached this point. Now you get to deal with us." Morgan doesn't look at all pleased about the prospect.

"Now, let's go over how you bypassed security measures."

"It's very technical. You two wouldn't understand," you say.

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Ontokinetic

Containment Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: If the sky begins changing color with no prior stimuli or indication, all Foundation sites are to go onto ALERT LEVEL 7 immediately. Personnel at Site-05 and -06 are to enter ALERT LEVEL 8 and begin evaluating new methods of containing SCP-001.

Site-05 has been constructed around Point Alpha. Procedure 001-ENTRY is in effect to contain SCP-001-1. A monitor containing Document 032, as well as a speaker reading the document, are to be placed at least five meters away from SCP-001-1. If SCP-001-1 swells up to 2 meters or more in diameter, the speed of the narration is to increase. This system is to have a direct cable link to the Foundation SCiPNET database at Site-06, and several redundant power generators are to ensure this system stays operational at all times.

Description: SCP-001 is an ongoing ZK-Class "Reality Failure" Scenario. SCP-001 is prevented from happening through several procedures manipulating its sub-anomalies. The only known observable symptom of SCP-001 is the sky becoming a different color; it is believed that, if SCP-001 were to progress to the point where other symptoms began to occur, it would become irreversible.

SCP-001-1 is a levitating object contained within Point Alpha, a cave chamber five kilometers south of the ruins of Babylon. SCP-001-1 visually resembles a perfectly smooth sphere with a texture similar to blurred television static. Measurement instruments indicate SCP-001-1 is currently 1.45 meters in diameter.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Solids and liquids that pass within the bounds of SCP-001-1 are replaced entirely with argon gas, giving the illusion of disappearing.

SCP-001-2 is an entity that is capable of being seen within Point Alpha. SCP-001-2's manifestations are random; witnesses report seeing SCP-001-2 "past the walls of the cave." From descriptions of eyewitnesses, SCP-001-2 is humanoid in shape and large in stature, and is only visible when looking through SCP-001-1. Descriptions of SCP-001-2 vary from person to person; common features include an emaciated figure, long limbs, and prominent facial features. SCP-001-2 takes the position of lying against the wall. It is most often seen with a neutral expression; however, the expression occasionally changes to discomfort or bliss.

It has been determined from historical precedent that "entertaining" SCP-001-2 through SCP-001-1 will prevent SCP-001.

History: Point Alpha and its contents are believed to date back to prehistory. Babylonian scripts indicate that SCP-001-1 was routinely patrolled by a group of sages, known as the "Order of White and Black," who refused passage to anyone who could demonstrate the ability to read or write.

This group was made defunct by the rise of Achaemenid Persia, which contained SCP-001-1 with a group of Zoroastrian monks. Very few accounts of SCP-001-1 are present; recovered accounts assert that all information about SCP-001-1 and its significance was passed orally.

The most substantial account of SCP-001-1 and SCP-001-2 at this time dates back to the Greek philosopher Xera, who made an expedition into the Achaemenid Empire and found Point Alpha. During Alexander of Macedon's conquest of the Achaemenid Empire, he took interest in Xera's texts and continued the Achaemenid containment of SCP-001-1. However, this new institution, known as the "Cronus Guard", was given Greek epics to read in order to "punish Cronus" for his actions.""")

The Cronus Guard were eventually replaced with an Islamic equivalent: "The Society for the Containment of the Babel Demon." This group was the first to perform substantial research on SCP-001-1, and the first to accurately link SCP-001 to SCP-001-1.

Viewing Attachment: Excerpts from the notes of the Society for the Containment of the Babel Demon

Literature Read: The first quatrain of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam

Result: DEMON squirms but otherwise does not react. Consistent with reading of Homer's Epics by the Chronus Guard.

Literature Read: The remaining quatrains of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam

Result: No changes from observed behavior.

Literature Read: A poem written by Guardian Muhammad ibn Buya'aa meant explicitly for DEMON

Result: DEMON thrashes more than usual until the cessation of the reading. ORB begins to expand until the Genealogies of the Nobles is read to DEMON.

Literature Read: None, for 10 days

Result: ORB is observed to expand, and DEMON is observed to thrash. Externally, the sky above the camp is noted to turn a darker red color, until the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is read again.

Literature Read: Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam

Result: DEMON thrashes more than during previous readings of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. It is believed that the Quran may no longer have any effect on DEMON.

Literature Read: One Thousand and One Nights

Result: DEMON ceases thrashing. New literature may be necessary to prevent further phenomena from occurring.

The Society was eventually absorbed into the Office for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts, who assumed containment of SCP-001-1. After Incident 001-EXAL, the Foundation purchased Point Alpha from ORIA for a large sum of currency and several Safe-class anomalies.""")

Incident 001-EXAL

Note: Some documentation taken from ORIA's account of Incident 001-EXAL.

On 2022-4-30, personnel with ORIA read the book Tafsir al-Ahlam al-kabir, or "Great Book of Interpretation of Dreams" as per normal containment of SCP-001-1. However, SCP-001-2 was observed to rapidly thrash while screaming. SCP-001-1 itself swelled from 50.3 centimeters to 3.2 meters in diameter.

Shortly following this event, SCP-001 began to worsen. The sky worldwide turned a black/white color similar to the texture of SCP-001-1. In addition, reality bending phenomena began worldwide, causing deformed geography, the manifestation of dangerous anomalous objects and several natural disasters. This event was ended after ORIA personnel read SCP-001-1 an undisclosed number of as-of-yet unread books, which caused SCP-001-2 to stop thrashing and SCP-001 to restore to its pre-incident point. However, the damage caused by this incident was deemed enough to require an activation of SCP-2000.

This prompted the Foundation to take control of containment of SCP-001. See History segment above for more information.

Discussion Thread 001-398:
Continued Containment
Started on: 2023-4-30

Started by: HMCL Robinson

HMCL Robinson: The usage of this thread will be for containment directives for SCP-001. In the past year that we have spent containing it, SCP-001-1's literature needs have become increasingly draconic: we can very rarely reread books without it beginning to thrash, and even then we're running out of high-quality literature to give it. We need a more long-term, reliable solution for containment. SCP-001's file has been temporarily opened up to all personnel with Level 2 clearance. Anybody can submit an idea.

Proposal: Use Artificial Intelligence Constructs to automatically generate new stories for SCP-001-2.

Status: [ APPROVED ]

Result: TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic was able to generate 10,000 volumes of stories imitating Greek literature. However, when the first was read to SCP-001-1, it began thrashing beyond acceptable measures until it was read approved reading. No further computer-generated works are to be given to SCP-001-1.

Proposal: Hire a full team of authors to create literature for SCP-001-1.

Status: [ DENIED ]

Reason: In the past, literature written specifically for SCP-001-1 have failed to contain it (see: SCtBD Document #249). With SCP-001-2's current state this is not to be attempted again.

Proposal: Read mainlist documentation for SCP-███ to SCP-001-1.

Status: [ DENIED ]

Reason: This could represent a possible information leak. Test denied.

Proposal: Read mainlist documentation for SCP-███ to SCP-001-1.

Status: [ APPROVED ]

Reason: With SCP-001-2's recent containment breach, these measures are approved.

Result: SCP-001-2 observed to stop thrashing and stay completely still, seemingly smiling. In addition, SCP-███ was able to be read for 14 consecutive readings before SCP-001-2 resumed normal activity.

Proposal: Regularly read mainlist documentation for SCP-001-1.""")

Proposal: Replacement of the SCP-001 file with several "001 Proposals" with much more grand implications than normal SCP files.

Status: [ APPROVED ]

Result: By only occasionally reading 001 files, SCP-001-2 is observed to be more calm on average. The previously observed actions of retaliation in response to specially crafted literature do not apply here.

Proposal: Expansion of the SCP Series beyond SCP-999, and declassification of several unnumbered SCP objects into these slots.

Status: [ APPROVED ]

Proposal: Given the variation of the current 2957 SCP mainlist files, SCP-001-1 is to be read a random arrangement of these files, in repeat.

Status: [ APPROVED ]

Result: This strategy succeeded for approximately 3 years, allowing for several repeats. However, on 2026-9-30, SCP-001-2 began thrashing rapidly, requiring newer documentation to sedate.

Proposal: Expansion of the SCP Series beyond SCP-4999, and declassification of several unnumbered SCP objects into these slots.

Status: [ DENIED ]

Reason: SCP-001-1 has required progressively more SCP mainlist articles for containment, even to the point of the fabrication of some anomalous entities.

Proposal: Rewriting of several older SCP mainlist files to be more exaggerated and narrative-like.

Status: [ TENTATIVELY APPROVED ]

Item #: SCP-0001

Object Class: Thaumiel/Apollyon

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-0001 cannot and should not be contained by the Foundation.

Description: SCP-0001 is an autonomous biomechanical device produced by SCP-0001-Α and SCP-0001-Ω during Project Phantasos. SCP-0001 is semi-sapient, hosting a consciousness sustained in a perpetual state of REM sleep. Although Project Phantasos designed SCP-0001’s physical form to be completely self-maintaining, self-sustaining and self-preserving while exposed to sunlight, its location within the Oneiroi Collective is believed to have altered these biological functions; it is hypothesised that SCP-0001 does not require any sustenance whatsoever, and may be immune to, or capable of regenerating from, any damage incurred.

The dream state experienced by SCP-0001 functions as a simulated reality based upon a narrative input during Project Phantasos. Due to its fluid nature, this reality has undergone numerous changes since its initiation and now feature rampant fluctuating details and self-conflictions; the primary narrative, however, has not been catastrophically damaged by these, and inhabitants of the reality are predominantly oblivious to these changes.

Documentation regarding Project Kallinikos and the creation of SCP-2140 is also requested for these same reasons.

If destruction of these anomalies is required to utilise and replicate components of their properties, the use of SCP-038 to generate cloned replicas of each item will enable such to be achieved without the loss of the original anomalies, which can be returned to containment once Project Phantasos has awakened.

In order for the final product of Project Phantasos to achieve its intended function, the hotdogs must be warm — cold potatoes don't roll downhill without effort — or else we cannot turn off the switches for all active Scranton Reality Anchors and Xyank/Anastasakos Constant Temporal Sinks, including all such devices developed, produced and utilised without the Foundation's knowledge; failure to do so would result in a high risk of the produced narrative state becoming dangerously destabilised.

I have received news that the Overseer council of the Foundation has approved Project Phantasos. The facility is currently under construction.

All conducted tests have resulted in uniform failure. The devices are capable of functioning in idle mode but suffer catastrophic failures upon initialisation of the collapse program:

Sub-Alpha 1 and Sub-Omega 1 overloaded upon activation.
Sub-Alpha 2 collapsed itself, but Sub-Omega 2 did not receive the appropriate transmission.
Sub-Alpha 3 was absorbed by Sub-Omega 3 before it initialised its collapse.

The final test indicates that the absorption program is functional. Requests have been lodged to Pasithea Division for non-biological replicas, to allow Erebus Division to continue development.

The collapse program functions successfully. The transmitted files are disorganised, but several test subjects were identified after transmission. Tests using the replicas produce consistent results.

Production of a reversal program has been deemed redundant. If the final product of Project Phantasos is initialised, attempted reversal is irrelevant.

Erebus Division is proceeding to ensure complete overrides of all physical safety precautions through a universal overload of all relevant SRA and/or XACTS units. Mobile Task Force Gamma-1 (‘Lime Left Hand’) is increasing security.

Analysis of the replica devices has revealed they are both continuously functioning at minimum capacity without staff knowledge; the Device Alpha replica has repeatedly initialised small-scale collapses and transmitted the information to the Device Omega replica.

SCP-0001 has told us we are unable to delete the collapse programming without rendering the Device Alpha replica totally inert. The connection between the two replicas has been severed instead.

The Device Omega replica produced this paraphysics formula overnight. Device Alpha is the component intended to innovate, whereas Device Omega exclusively stores and processes data. The replicas are still connected, despite the deletion of the relevant coding.

Discussion with Pasithea Division confirmed the provided Device Alpha replica was formerly used to test the conversion of mechanical and digital components into biological material; this has been attributed as the source of the connection. Further investigation revealed the Device Omega replica has also undergone partial biological conversion.

It is theorised that the Device Alpha replica’s partial conversion enabled it to modify the absorption program into a mutual-update program, and the biological conversion was transmitted through this. Since Albert Einstein calculated relativity, this allowed the physical change to become a nictitating errata, indicating the replicas – and potentially the final products as well – have gained unforeseen anomalous properties.

The construction of the facility for Project Phantasos is approaching completion. No designation has been confirmed at this point in time.

There have been numerous power supply failures across Area-0001 for the past several days. The reactor is functioning at optimum capacity. The progress of Project Phantasos is being severely impeded by these problems.

Erebus division has confirmed that all extant Devices and derivatives have been disconnected from the power supply network, however personnel are still experiencing ongoing medical issues associated with their function.

The devices are continuing to expand beyond their expected range of capabilities. Due to their disconnection from the power supply network of Area-0001, the primary Device Alpha and Device Omega prototypes have initialised an anomalous program enabling them to redirect energy from the surrounding environment in order to power themselves. Investigation into the limits of this program is ongoing, however the area of effect is known to encompass everything we comprehend as colour, and is capable of deriving from both active and passive sources of energy in both mechanical and biological objects or entities.

All attempts to remove or impede this program have failed, with the deleted data falling out of our brains onto the screens immediately. The Device Alpha prototype and Device Omega prototype have been reconnected to the power supply network of Area-0001. Ten Scranton Reality Anchors have been established and initialised in the immediate vicinity around both Device prototypes in order to inhibit their anomalous properties.

A member of staff attempted to destroy the Device Alpha prototype using his frozen aspirations assembled from various scavenged ideologies found across Area-0001. The prototype pre-emptively initialised a small-scale collapse centred on the offending member of staff. No damage was incurred by the Device Alpha prototype.""")

Investigation into the incident confirms that the SRAs were simultaneously destroyed by localised Akiva spikes, enabling the prototype to enact its Hume-based collapse programming.

The consensus theory amongst Project Phantasos personnel is that SCP-0001 submitted this event for consideration, which was approved by the SCP-0001 committee.

Mobile Task Force Gamma-1 (‘Lucid Left Hand’) has ordered the indefinite postponement of all Project Phantasos activities.

The prototypes are continuing to advance beyond controllable parameters. Monitoring of the devices show they are transcending recursion to self-complete themselves.

All attempts to impede or disable the devices has failed due to seemingly random impediments ensuring no antagonistic actions against the devices can be achieved.

The Overseer Council is discussing whether to proceed with the final stage of Project Phantasos considering the final products’ extensive capabilities to surpass defined parameters. Project Phantasos staff are discussing whether the Overseer Council’s willingness to proceed is derived from the final products’ probability-affecting anomalous property.

RE: Re:Re:Omega Final Location?

If Erebus Division successfully programs Device Alpha to recognise both Device Alpha and Device Omega as a singular object, preventing it from collapsing the components individually, this proposal should be satisfactory.

Upon initialisation of the collapse program, Device Alpha will exclude Device Omega, transmitting the created information to the databanks of Device Omega. Once Device Alpha determines there is nothing remaining for it to collapse, it will prompt Device Omega, and run a timer program that ensures the two devices are synchronised. When confirmed, Device Omega will initiate its absorption program at the same time Device Alpha initiates a collapse of Device Omega.

Special Containment Procedures: An SCP-001 containment breach constitutes the initiation of a UZ-Class Grey Goo scenario, and the immediate redesignation of the anomaly as Apollyon Class.

SCP-001 is contained in its specialised containment chamber at Site-01. This containment chamber must be kept structurally sound at all times. No entryways are to be added to the containment chamber, nor are any extant ones to be opened under any circumstances.

No items, objects, and/or personnel are to be introduced into SCP-001’s containment chamber under any circumstances. No items, objects, and/or personnel introduced to SCP-001’s containment chamber are to be retrieved under any circumstances.

Any personnel attempting to retrieve any items, objects, and/or personnel from SCP-001’s containment chamber are to be immediately terminated, regardless of any and all former positions, accolades, and/or privileges as a member of the Foundation. Any personnel suspected of planning an attempt to retrieve any items, objects, and/or personnel from SCP-001’s containment chamber are to be immediately detained and removed from Site-01, with all privileges suspended pending further investigation.

Description: SCP-001 are the animate, deceased cadavers of a human.

All SCP-001 instances are superficially undergoing advanced putrefaction; no loss of mass has been observed for any SCP-001 instances, nor has shed mass built up within the containment chamber. SCP-001 instances roam their containment chamber in a manner mimicking the behaviours of a standard, living human.""")

SCP-001 instances interact with their environment anachronistically; they are capable of passing through any region of space that has, is, or (theoretically) will be unoccupied, regardless of whether or not the space is currently occupied;1 this property effectively enables SCP-001 instances to pass through any solid matter they predate or outlast.

SCP-001 instances constantly and erratically duplicate themselves, typically when performing tasks with multiple possible outcomes; in such cases, a new SCP-001 instance will manifest for each outcome. SCP-001 instances are also capable of recombining and will do so when two or more instances perform identical actions.

The anomalous properties of SCP-001 manifested when the individual was assassinated by an unidentified military group shortly prior to the formation of the Foundation. The founding High Command was successful in containing SCP-001 within its childhood bedroom2 before the anomaly replicated, enabling successful containment.

Whenever SCP-001-1 and/or SCP-001-A are involved with an event beyond exclusively providing predictions on its outcomes, SCP-001-A will typically produce a significant number of blatantly incorrect predictions based upon one of the following false factors:

That SCP-001-1 was allegedly assassinated by a military group prior to containment, and as a result, SCP-001-A was never constructed;
That, along with its standard anomalous properties, SCP-001-1 also exhibits SCP-001-A’s anomalous properties, and that SCP-001-A was never constructed.

MAXIMUM CLEARANCE
HIGH COMMAND / OVERSEER COUNCIL / OVERWATCH EYES ONLY

It is the consensus agreement of High Command (HC), the Overseer Council (OC) and Overwatch (OW) that SCP-001 (Δ) is a causal loop focusing on the Founder of the Foundation at the time period the Foundation was established. As a result of SCP-001’s anomalous influence, there are three distinct timelines generated from this point in time.

The details of the timelines, as agreed upon by their respective High Command, Overseer Council, or Overwatch, is as following.

Timeline ‘HC’

SCP-001 conceived the notion of the Foundation by their own volition but was assassinated by an unidentified military group – speculated to be an alternate rendition of Mobile Task Force Alp-0 originating from Timeline OC and/or Timeline OW – before they could directly enact the establishment of the organisation.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" This period corresponds to the initiation of SCP-001’s anomalous properties in Timelines OC and OW.

However, SCP-001 was successful in promoting sufficient interest in the endeavour prior to their demise – and further catalysed by the clearly-anomalous circumstances around their assassination – to prompt the original thirteen members of High Command to do so in their stead.

The now-anomalous cadaver/s of SCP-001, another catalyst for High Command’s actions, was successfully contained in the childhood home of SCP-001 – one of the few extant buildings at the time that predated SCP-001 (of which, at the time of writing, it exclusively remains) – before the anomaly began duplicating.

How the founding High Command knew to contain SCP-001 at this location, and why they avoided using the door – instead lowering the anomaly through a hole in the ceiling – is unknown; no documentation justifying the decision, if any existed, have been found.

Being the first anomaly contained by the Foundation, it was designated SCP-001 following the official codification of the SCP designation.

Timeline ‘OC’

SCP-001 was in the process of establishing the Foundation – alongside the members of the original Overseer Council – when they began exhibiting anomalous properties, roughly corresponding to the point in time when Mobile Task Force Alp-0 intervened in Timelines HC and OW; however, no evidence has been found indicating MTF Alp-0 has been present in Timeline OC.

Recognising SCP-001 as a new anomalous phenomenon, the founding Overseer Council immediately devised and enforced containment measures for SCP-001, cataloguing it as their first contained anomaly.

Timeline ‘OW’

In Timeline OW, the Founder encounters an anachronistic military group self-identifying by the moniker Mobile Task Force Alp-0.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" This MTF presents the Founder with schematics for SCP-001-A (OW) and assist in its construction, which is completed at the time SCP-001 is assassinated in Timeline HC / gains properties in Timeline OC. Upon completion of this task, MTF Alp-0 departs.

The Founder establishes the modern Foundation for the explicit purpose of studying SCP-001-A (OW), with the original Overwatch being their initial research group; following the discovery of further anomalous phenomena that posed various threats to the Founder, Overwatch and/or their notion of normal society, the function of the Foundation expanded to include the containment and research of these phenomena as well.

Recognising their abnormal lack of aging in comparison to the founding Overwatch, the Founder voluntarily submitted themselves to containment and study. Following the discovery of SCP-001 (Δ), the Founder was redesignated as a component of SCP-001 (OW).

It is the consensus agreement of the leading committees that SCP-001 was discovered through the unintentional preservation of the Foundation database across all three timelines. It is currently unclear how this data preservation is occurring, but is confirmed to be instantaneous relative to each timeline’s analogue of the creation date; a file created on January 1st, 2018 at 8:00 PM in Timeline HC will simultaneously appear in the database present in Timeline OC and Timeline OW on January 1st, 2018 at 8:00 PM.

Cooperation between the leading committees of each respective timeline has led to the conclusion that the majority of recorded anomalous phenomena present in the shared database only exist within one timeline; only 17 anomalies have been confirmed to exist across all three timelines.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Considering the presence of ‘Mobile Task Force Alp-0’ in both Timeline HC and Timeline OW, the consensus belief is that SCP-001 (Δ) is preserved through unclear future events that prompt the leading committees of the Foundations to dispatch this MTF, at a future date, with the intent of altering the circumstances of the Foundation’s conception, creating the next successive timeline. The order of timelines is unknown, but deemed irrelevant.

As evidenced by SCP-001’s (HC) inability to escape its containment chamber, it is agreed that MTF Alp-0 will be dispatched prior to the destruction of the containment chamber. It is believed that, as Timeline HC will be overwritten by either Timeline OC or Timeline OW as a result of this, this will result in the immediate cessation of Timeline HC, and the loss of all contents; further extrapolation based upon the fact that similar events occur at similar times across all three timelines strongly suggests Timeline OC and Timeline OW will also terminate at that time.

As a result, it is the unanimous agreement of the leading committees that SCP-001 (Δ) must be neutralised to prevent the cessation of one or all three timelines, and the resultant loss of the Foundation and humanity.

Questioning of SCP-001 (OC) by the Overseer Council has revealed that the device they intend to construct specifically executes this purpose. Cooperation between the Overseer Council and Overwatch has confirmed that SCP-001-A (OW) is similar to the device intended for construction by SCP-001 (OC). Analysis of SCP-001-A (OW) has failed to confirm how the device would be, or is, capable of neutralising SCP-001 (Δ), however SCP-001-1 (OW) has similarly confirmed the device is capable of performing this task but has failed to provide further clarification.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Because of the various SCP-001’s (HC, OC, OW) assumed (in the case of Timeline OC) desire to construct this device, and their otherwise apparent fundamental relation to SCP-001 (Δ), it is the consensus belief of the leading committees that the completion of this device across all three timelines will result in the neutralisation of SCP-001 (Δ), or at minimum enable more viable containment of SCP-001 (HC, OC) through minimisation or neutralisation of their anomalous properties.

As such, the leading committees of each timeline have agreed to complete the following:

High Command will receive the schematics of SCP-001-A (OW) and construct it, activating it as soon as able.
The Overseer Council will voluntarily release SCP-001 (OC) from containment, providing them with the required resources to construct SCP-001-A.
Overwatch will provide schematics for SCP-001-A (OW) to High Command and the Overseer Council. No other actions are required, as their device is already complete.
The leading committees will cooperate to maximise the probability of this file, along with as much of the main Foundation database as possible, surviving into the ensuing timeline produced by SCP-001’s (Δ) neutralisation, for the explicit purpose of detailing SCP-001 (Δ) and its neutralisation to ensure the anomaly does not reform.

Description: SCP-001-D (formerly designated as SCP-001 (Δ)) allegedly was a causal loop that resulted in the cyclic recreation of three similar but distinct timelines. These timelines diverged at the time of the Foundation’s establishment, under three distinct circumstances:

The Founder becomes an anomaly during the process of establishing the Foundation. The founding Overseer Council1 contain it as an SCP-001, as per the Founder’s original wishes.
An anachronistic Mobile Task Force (Alp-0), believed to originate from the terminus of one of the timelines, provides the Founder with the schematics for an anomalous device and assists them in constructing it. The Foundation is established expressly to study this device, beginning with the founding Overwatch;2 the Founder is later recognised to be anomalous, and willingly submits to containment as an SCP-001.
An anachronistic military force, believed to be MTF Alp-0 or an alternate rendition of such, assassinates the Founder. The founding High Command3 completes the establishment of the Foundation in their absence, and contains the anomalous corpse of the Founder as an SCP-001.
In all cases, SCP-001-D was discovered through the preservation of files within the main Foundation database across all timelines, purportedly enabled through standard anomalous protection countermeasures. It is noteworthy that SCP-001-D was discovered by the (current/remaining timeline’s) Foundation when several corrupted files were discovered throughout the main database.

SCP-001-D was reportedly decommissioned through a joint effort between the Overseer Council, Overwatch and High Command.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Information recovered from the surviving files strongly suggests, however, that the decommissioning of SCP-001-D has resulted in a timeline drastically less viable than its predecessors, as the entirety of the SCP catalogue – of which all but seventeen only existed in one of the three timelines produced by SCP-001-D – have been forced to co-exist within the same timeline.

As evidenced by rampant containment failures, the loss of numerous critical Sites and Areas, and ongoing underfunding despite assistance through the Bowe and Mulhausen Commissions, it is infeasible for any singular Foundation to function effectively under such conditions; furthermore, the ongoing ZK-Class Rat’s Nest Scenario proves that no singular timeline is capable of supporting the coexistence of numerous anomalies with conflicting properties.

SCP-001-D has been marked as a point of investigation for Project Lif. In the event the Lifthrasir Protocol is initiated, the conditions under which SCP-001-D was neutralised – as detailed from surviving files – is to be replicated with the inclusion of SCP-14089, SCP-24601 and SCP-55555, in the hope doing so will result in the production of a more viable timeline.

Two copies exist, one is located within a secured headquarters and the location of the other is known to the Overseers. "Red Right Hand” has successfully seized all documentation of Incident-001-Γ which are not currently available to any public.

Quality of life health insurance plans and any extraordinary medical expenses1 are to be provided to the witnesses of Incident-001-Γ.

Massive publicizing and public re-affirmation of established perspectives on Incident-001-Γ are to be disseminated through both reputable and alternative news sources in order to blunt the spread of uncontrolled manufactured information.

Description

SCP-001 is the projectile which killed U.S. President John F. Kennedy, fired by an unidentifiable number of assailants acting simultaneously as part of one or more conspiracies. Upon impact, human perception began falling out of sync with objective reality at an individual level.

The events surrounding SCP-001's trajectory are designated as Incident-001-Γ.

Individuals with living memory of Incident-001-Γ are the last population of humanity able to agree on any shared concept of truth, their shared experience in seeing or hearing about Incident-001-Γ. The percentage of still-living eyewitnesses negatively correlates to the density of unnatural potential energy manifesting in the observable universe as anomalous phenomenon.

Their collective memory provides a consistent base of widely, but not universally, held truths. This in turn stabilizes the increasingly individualized SCP-001 perspectives, as it is the last living shared
certain truth among Earth's population.

S. I - Summary of Events & Suspects
On 11/22/1963, at 12:30 p.m, Lee Oswald fired two bullets from the sixth floor of the Texas Schoolbook Depository. Oswald's first shot missed, striking a concrete curb. The second shot mortally wounded the President and injured the Governor. A third shot (SCP-001) lethally vaporized U.S. President Kennedy's cranial cavity.

For the approximate decade between Incident-001-Γ and the ascension of President Gerald Ford, SCP-001's effect was widespread but largely benign. The disparity between perception and reality was growing, but gradually and in a linear fashion. The fractalization did not begin to occur until the failed attempt to assassinate President Ford on September 5, 1975 by Lynn "Squeaky" Fromme.

In both crowds, all witnesses reported seeing differing versions of the events, most of which did not have President Ford surviving. Two weeks later, Sara Jane Moore made a subsequent attempt on Ford's life in order to reconcile her knowledge of his death with his visible living person. The exponential spread of SCP-001's effect can be demonstrated by Gerald Ford's sincere belief from at least 1976 until his death that the Soviet Union had withdrawn from eastern Europe during the Nixon administration.""")

Police Log - Babushka Lady

Foreword: The so-called "Babushka lady" was briefly held in custody by the Dallas Police, giving a brief statement before she was released. There is no record as to when or why she was released from custody.

BL: Yeah, I saw old man Zapruder with that 'camera', right? Pretty good view from that pillar, especially since the TV crew wasn't there to hog the space. I'm sure a few frames with extra white puffs will just happen to go missing, right?

My grandmother loved to play the games she could win. Her favorite was Find the Lady. All you need is a ball, three cups, and a rube to play. There was never a shortage of eager and willing rubes.

Grammy relished in showing off every cup as slow as she could, then covering the ball and going to work once she had their trust. Rube watching, she'd shuffle and move 'em all around fast as tilt-a-whirls. Rube, with luck, picks the right cup. Oh, the sweet talk she'd use to string them along, come on, double down, let's play one more time, just for the laughs. Poor saps get convinced they've sliced the gambling knot. Everyone was ready to think they were special.
We both had a sixth sense for knowing when rubes were getting ready to cash out. By then, they're not even the same person they were when the game started, not after they've been on a hot streak long enough that the money's as good as half-spent to them.

Zapruder is being played as a shell game. That's the point. If you've seen any home movies— the shaky blurs, the way the timing always seems just a little 'off'? That's by design.""")

The Kennedy Administration has been a disaster for time and space.

Hello, if this take sounds good enough for government work, then it shall be dropping off outside one of your fake used bookstores that really trades in god-knows-what.

There are a million different ways I know you're looking for me, so don't bother looking for a leak. Waste of time. My name is Louie Steven Witt and you can come talk to me if you want to.

It was my intention to let President Kennedy know of my displeasure towards him. It was a secret symbol, the umbrella, one only he and I would know. Not only would it be disrespectful to the late President, but also his family line.

My umbrella can shoot blow darts, yes. But it didn't. I didn't have any of them on me, I only brought this particular umbrella because it is my only black one. Came directly from the Prime Minister, oh, Neville, you ravishing cad.

I've been so lonely since then. The last time I shared any great excitement. I could see the pallor on the faces of passers-by. Truth be told, they probably all saw me the same way. Well, in each of their own little ways they saw me as they saw the world:

Skewed, and a little cracked. Fragile, holding together, but, fundamentally?

Broken.

Secretary Reedy Tape

Foreword: George Reedy was appointed Press Secretary by President Johnson after the latter's accession to power.

I remember someone once told me Kennedy knew it was a killbox. 100% certainty. There were a thousand ways to die in Dealy Plaza, and Kennedy had made peace with all of them. Why? Back was killing him. The job was killing him.""")

Tragedy should make us come together as one. But now you, and I, and everything, it's split up in little black boxes, I'm not paranoid. The walls have closed in and now we're standing straight up in the dark. I was there when it happened.

My first thanksgiving after, everybody on my Mom's side of the family was convinced that I had been convicted of the President's murder. Then, I started to remember it too. I could hear Lyndon's boasting that we would have the greatest administration of all time, and we'd lick the Soviets too. Maybe it did happen that way, I haven't convinced myself enough to be sure. So… I know I squeezed a trigger but I can't remember whose hand it was I was squeezing, if that makes sense.

S. II - Individual-Aggregate Level Veil Effect
The most common effect of SCP-001 is frustration. The belief that one is skilled, but unable to get a job, or that they are wonderful people yet nobody seems to like them. Unable to understand that they are being paid less than they think they are. Feeling cramped and confined even if they see themselves living in a big house all to themselves.

Wrongness is there, it can be felt, but it cannot be explained. It manifests in psychological disorders such as Imposter Syndrome. At a certain level, they know that they don't belong. One more way to feel the lonesomeness of SCP-001.

Those with less self-awareness may be promoted via the Dilbert Principle, that incompetent individuals will be promoted until they can no longer do damage. This is a natural organizational self-defense measure as the structure is aware something is wrong, even if none of the participants themselves are able to.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

The so-called "Mandela Effect" arises when the degree to which any given person is out of sync with reality drifts further in their living memory, so that what was true to them once is no longer so. However, this is easily rationalized and is not considered to be damaging except in rare cases.

Analysis of social movements derived from SCP-001 was at first limited to immediate interpretation of the Kennedy Assassination, but following disruption of the assassination attempt on Gerald Ford and the subsequent lack of new renewals of blood, the fracturing of collective truth has continued on its path to disintegration.

When a critical mass of knowledge an individual is able to interpret as factual have no connection to reality as defined by physical laws and natural forces, it will frequently cause them to disconnect most of their familial and social relationships. This withdrawal is usually a result of frustration and confusion. They may begin to make new social connections in small networks of those who find that their alternative viewpoints overlap on at least some measures.

Even in these extreme cases, this does not prevent those with heavily altered viewpoints from carrying out the functions which have become routine. This is more a result of muscle memory, as their will to engage with the wider world is totally broken by their SCP-001 experience.

Conclusions:
There is no purpose on speculating who killed President Kennedy. Every guess is correct to someone.

Nobody can see the world the same way as anyone else. That's just the way it is.

Normalcy is a comfort to those confused by SCP-001, and should be provided whenever possible.

NOTICE FROM THE RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION

The following document was received on 08.10.2026 from the relict dimension R-42 and describes an anomaly threatening all members of humankind in all extant worlds. It has been established that, before the message was received, a signal had been emitted for eight minutes, containing an exceptionally powerful (stability and penetration class 5) cognitohazard of danger class 0 (safe). The Foundation was unable to counteract this anomaly, but no residual symptoms of it affecting the minds of Earth denizens have been found to this day. ~~There is a high threat of repeated cognitohazardous or other forms of attack from dimension R-42.~~ According to the latest measurements, dimension R-42 no longer exists.
The following message tested negative for hidden memetic agents and is safe to read.

Document Start

Greetings.

You are reading this dossier in a paradimension of the relict dimension R-42.

Due to the colossal size of your world's address, for your convenience, your dimension will be hereafter referred to as "PD".

The following message has been constructed by the SCP Foundation of the relict dimension R-42 and is addressed to the SCP Foundation of paradimension PD. Enclosed you will find information about SCP-001, which is a threat to the multiverse.

As you may have noticed, this message was preceded by a burst signal containing a non-dangerous cognitohazard. The burst signal was constructed in such a way that minimal change to the signal would have caused indiscriminate and overwhelming casualties among the denizens of PD. As you can see, R-42 is capable of eliminating the absolute majority of PD denizens but has not exercised this capability. In the context of the above, we ask you to consider this action not as an act of aggression, but as a demonstration of the fact that R-42 has no pretension for conquest or other forms of aggression towards PD.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Take the following information in earnest.

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Paradox-Apollyon1

Special Containment Procedures: The only known way to guarantee destruction of the anomaly and avoidance of the ZK-Class cross-reality failure event is the full annihilation (or fundamental change) of humankind. The list of possible measures to push back (or completely avert) the incoming 001-ZK event has been outlined below.

Problem Description: SCP-001 consists of all living members of the Homo sapiens species without exception. These currently include humans living in the relict dimension R-42 and the PD paradimension. The anomaly first came into existence and developed in the relict dimension R-42, and later activated in PD by accident. Unchecked growth of SCP-001 will cause annihilation of the entire multiverse.

It is known to our researchers that, at the moment of the Big Bang, the formation of a finite number of parallel dimensions (57 in total) happened in an event referred to as "Alpha". Creation of new dimensions in natural conditions (without disruption) is impossible. Due to unknown causes humanity came to exist in only one of the 57 relict dimensions - in dimension R-42.

The danger to reality that SCP-001 poses lies in its anomalous capability for wide-scale replication of paradimensions. This term refers to a parallel reality which has an extremely small deviation from its "parent". It is known that any conceived human decision (even those completely inconsequential) occurring within time complements the multiverse with N paradimensions (where N is the number of choices in the decision), wherein a unique resolution to the event occurs in each. As such, dimensions housing living instances of SCP-001 uncontrollably "grow" a colossal number of minimally differing paradimensions every second.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Other relict dimensions (R-01 to R-57, barring R-42) do not have paradimensions, as humanity has not come to exist in those dimensions due to unknown causes, and as such, all processes therein follow natural physical laws only. R-42's SCP Foundation is not aware of whether other relict dimensions contain other forms of sapient life, but even if it does exist, there is no sign of further paradimension replication in those dimensions.

R-42's analytics have determined a ceiling on the colossal amount of paradimensions, surpassing which will destroy the multiverse as a whole. This value is referred to as "Omega". There is no visual way to represent this number, an estimation of "Omega" is enclosed in the Addenda and can only be deduced through a cascade of highly challenging mathematical calculations. In roughest estimation, accounting for the current speed of approach of the number of parallel dimensions to "Omega", predictions for growth of PD's populace, and the worst-case scenario (full refusal of your paradimension to counteract the anomaly), the death of the multiverse (also known as the ZK-Class cross-reality failure event) can be expected to occur within 0.3 years ± 2 months after the reception of this message.

The paradimensions created through replication exist in a state of "existence uncertainty" (or "stasis"). While indirectly affecting the stability of the multiverse and objectively forming due to the effects of SCP-001, each paradimension does not exhibit signs of its existence due to the lack of any physical processes within it. This state is broken after opening a spacetime tunnel into the dimension. At that moment the "existence uncertainty" ends and the paradimension begins to "exist" in the full meaning of this term. All physical processes begin to flow as if they always have been from the Big Bang to the moment of the dimension's formation.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Due to the fact that new beings (humans, SCP-001) come into existence with the abolition of "existence uncertainty", this dimension becomes a source of paradimension replication in itself.

You and your paradimension PD were created approximately 17.4 R-42-years ago and afterwards remained in a state of "existence uncertainty" for an extended period of time (from R-42's point of view). Emergence from this state and beginning of you and your dimension's factual existence happened approximately 0.7 PD-years ago after an exploratory portal from R-42 was briefly opened into your world. As such, the society of R-42 technologically and historically surpasses PD by approximately 16.7 years, which has allowed R-42's SCP Foundation to discover SCP-001 and develop computing solutions of colossal scale, which in turn considerably advanced the research of this anomaly.

History of R-42 society's efforts against the anomaly: SCP-001 was discovered by Foundation researchers approximately 5.1 R-42-years ago. The "Omega" value was calculated soon after, and the fact of the number of extant parallel dimensions' catastrophically quick approach to that limit was found. A special research group from relict dimension R-42 began developing methods of complete or partial suppression of paradimension replication to prevent (or postpone by any possible measure of time) the occurrence of a ZK-class cross-reality failure event.

Unfortunately, R-42's SCP Foundation had to go to extreme measures to delay the ZK-Class event as much as possible. Operations "Castling" and "Minimal Gain" were developed for that purpose.

The O5 Council assembled Roster-1, which included all persons who have vital scientific or other importance to SCP-001 research, and Roster-2, which included all persons who were needed to perform fieldwork during the interim period of Operation "Minimum Gain". To enhance morale, one family member (of choice) per person was included in each list.""")

Stage 1: Neutralised all contained "Keters" and all "Euclids" whose containment incurred considerable cost.

Stage 2: Operation "Castling". Launched rockets with "Variant C-Global" amnestic-dispersing warheads. Established control over dignitaries of all national and transnational organizations, mass-media, religious leaders. By the end of the Operation, the Foundation had established absolute control over all states and all spheres of human life on the planet.

Stage 3: Destroyed all hazardous radioactive, chemical, bacteriological, etc. objects. Shut down and re-cultivated nuclear power plants, chemical plants, bio-laboratories, mothballed all extractive industries, enacted hydroelectric dam outlet and demolition, moored and drained fuel from all ships.

Stage 4: Concurrently with the previous stage, dispersed viral agents over "third world" countries (largely safe for countries with other climates and levels of healthcare development).

Stage 5: Added deactivation-resistant viral agents to water treatment and collection plants, food products, medications, and household items of developed countries.

Stage 6: All surviving SCP-001 not included in the Rosters (approx. 0.1% of Earth denizens) pursued via strike drone aircraft and Foundation personnel. Survivors collected in concentration camps to perform decisive liquidation-conservation efforts on the planet surface, and to sample those fittest to preserve humankind.

Stage 7: 15000 humans selected and driven into cryosleep. Remaining survivors eliminated.

Stage 8: Eliminated Roster-2 personnel and their family members.

As a result of actions undertaken, the cross-reality failure event has been delayed by a considerable margin, and the speed of approach has been slowed to a minimum.""")

The most prospective paths of development at that moment were the creation of will- and reasoning variability-dampening devices, as well as projects around delegating the consciousnesses of all survivors to a central processing unit. Under most modest estimations, accounting for highly limited human resources, the realization of these projects would take 9 to 15 years out of those available (at the moment) to the Foundation before the onset of the ZK-Class event.

Use of SCP-objects or other technologies to eliminate derivative dimensions. Proposal rejected. Considering the list of SCP-objects remaining in possession, the proposal was practically inapplicable due to slow speed of realization, unable to contest with the speed of approach to "Omega".

Consequential return to Earth and re-establishment of humanity in hopes of the number of parallel realities decreasing naturally in the future. Proposal rejected. Does not constitute a conclusive solution to the problem.
Destruction of Earth and/or all of its inhabitants. Proposal rejected. This scenario assumes preservation of derivative paradimensions and, as such, likewise preserves risk of anomaly reactivation should a portal into any paradimension be opened by any extant or possible future life form.
Use of SCP-0000. Development finished.
Unfortunately, at the time very little was known about paradimensions themselves, and the "existence uncertainty" theory had not been developed as of yet. Various researchers proposed a theory that lack of paradimension replication from paradimensions (a process visually akin to an uncontrolled fission reaction) could signify that humans existing in them were not SCP-001, and that, as such, they could be excellent test material for R-42. The O5 Council made a decision to begin development on technology to open a cross-dimension spacetime tunnel into a random paradimension based on remaining anomalous materials at the Foundation's disposal for the purpose of studying it. This paradimension turned out to be your paradimension, PD.

The portal developed by R-42 specialists proved to be highly unstable. The Foundation personnel could not choose a paradimension to enter (PD became the target by chance); additionally, after having existed for an insubstantial period of time (approximately two days), the spacetime tunnel spontaneously closed. At that same time, it was discovered that your world became a source of paradimensions in itself.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" When considered along with the fact that PD existed in precisely the state R-42 was in at the moment of PD's creation, a hypothesis about "existence uncertainty" was established. R-42's SCP Foundation chose to make no further attempts to open a portal into PD due to the high risk of accidentally afflicting other dimensions with the anomaly.

From the moment PD began to produce its paradimensions and bring the multiverse closer to the ZK-Class event with high speed, R-42 was left no time or hope for salvation. Unfortunately, R-42's Foundation cannot open a portal into your dimension and destroy PD denizens by itself. R-42 has waived aside the idea of eliminating the majority of PD denizens because the PD's Foundation personnel, surviving in underground bunkers and bearing access to numerous "Thaumiel"-class objects, would render such actions moot. Little remaining time before the ZK-Class event and lack of technological capability to maintain our research denies the possibility to repeat Operations "Castling" and "Minimal Gain". Due to the outlined causes, we address you with this message and offer the only way in current conditions to save the multiverse.

The world has existed before us and must remain after us. Our multiverse is ill, and the name of the illness is humanity, SCP-001. The only way out is SCP-0000. We'll cease to become a threat with its help. It is in our power to leave a chance for other sapient species that, perhaps, will not be afflicted by the same anomaly, or will find a way to get rid of it before it's too late. We, the O5 Council and other survivors from R-42, have chosen our fate. We hope you will do the same.

Hello, dad.

I don't know if I have the right to call you "dad", for you are just a copy of the one I recently mourned the passing of. In some way, you are the cause of his death. But you are also a human who, like us, is not at fault for any of this.

In your world, I am just a little girl, and the one who's writing now is your grown-up daughter, one of the leading Foundation employees. Strange, isn't it? I didn't want to record a message, but my colleagues made me. They say it's very important. Well, I couldn't have a last word with him, so I'll have a last word with you. I'll address you and not "You", as if I had known you for so many years. Alright?

I remember the day the Rosters started to get implemented. Rosters of those for whose sake everyone else had to keep working. There was an idea to let the Overseers save not one member of family, but two. You yourself stood against it, believing that it would lead to an unhealthy schism within the Foundation that was about to become very, very small. Only a few hundred, that many were supposed to be left after the mad harvest you've planned.""")

You were implacable, and the day you began to assemble the Roster, I understood everything by the look in your eyes. You didn't save Mother. You chose to save me. I still don't know what to think about that. But… even if I had some sort of anger at yourself, it's long gone now.

I began to work alongside you. All the "hostages", as they were called behind backs, began to work on the Project. We had more than enough time. Hope was our guiding star.

On the days I felt especially miserable you led me out to the surface. We sat on the grass in hazard suits and watched over the empty city at the bottom of the mountain. The city that only birds of hunt inhabit now. You promised that we'd return there and build a giant monument to the Human at its center. I listened to you and knew it was a lie. Every single one of our prospective projects would've left nothing human in us. Our descendants would not waste themselves on sentiments.

Then… then someone proposed to open that portal. Fatal mistake. When you've learned the paradimension started replicating worlds you understood that… it was all over. There were flimsy ideas to open the portal again and throw some sort of a wonder bomb in there, but nobody had any guarantee that it would not open into a different paradimension. The countdown went down to months again. Your promise became impossible. You took your own life. In your honor, the seat of O5-1 was left vacant.

Truth be told, I don't care, now, whether you'll destroy your world or not. Whether the universe will exist, whether there will be new life in it. My world has been crushed long ago.

It's good that this message is encrypted with your key, that was passed on to me - or these lines would've been deleted. Everyone wants to save the world. But who needs it like this? Empty and cold. Without those to appreciate its beauty. Without humanity.

Do whatever you think is right.

SCP-001 is the designation for the first entry of the Foundation's anomaly database. SCP-001 is believed to amplify certain features of anomalies that are conceptually associated with its designation. The extent to which anomalies and/or their documentation are affected by SCP-001 is unknown and the mechanisms it uses are poorly understood.

Historically, the SCP-001 designation has been reserved for a series of retirement proposals known as the Heritage Collection. These are the product of an established Foundation tradition1 in which retiring A-Class personnel are eligible to submit a proposal of internal documents relating to an anomaly of personal significance. These documents exhibit a dramatic, less technical nature and are written in a more narratively-appealing tone than would be expected of a standard research proposal; the identification of these common characteristics led to the discovery of SCP-001's theorized effect.

The Heritage Collection has been moved to another file location, which causes the SCP-001 designation to refer to itself. In this state, SCP-001 appears to be effectively contained as there is little evidence to suggest that it is capable of amplifying itself.

Except for the aforementioned document, retirement proposals went undocumented until 1993, at which point twenty proposal documents were stored in the SCP-001 file after being updated to current database framework parameters.
These patterns of missing and/or conflicting evidence are thought to manifest as a result of CK-class reality-restructuring events, which could suggest that this is how SCP-001's effect operates. However, it remains unclear if this evidence results from the events detailed in the 001 document, or SCP-001's self-designation.

At this time, it appears that consensus reality aligns with the current SCP-001 document; it is to be considered tentatively valid until the extent of SCP-001's influence can be determined.

UPDATE 2001/07/01:

Upon publishing this report to SCiPnet, Site-01 maintenance systems detected unauthorized access within the secure database; the SCP-001 document was found to have been altered to include this report, despite being deliberately published elsewhere to avoid exposure to SCP-001's theorized effect. As such, the information within this report has been brought into question and should possess no more validity than any other documentation concerning SCP-001. This update is partially a test to see if new information continues to be reflected in the SCP-001 document.""")

UPDATE 2001/07/02:

Upon publishing the updated version of this report, a similar event occurred, resulting in the appearance of the above update in the SCP-001 document. Despite this, there is no internal record of any legitimate edits to the SCP-001 document. This implies that this report and its updates have always been part of the SCP-001 document, despite being written in response to the previous update. Archived versions of the SCP-001 file have been somehow altered to have always included information concerning SCP-001. Further updates of this nature will not be recorded.

UNVERIFIED UPDATE PLEASE IGNORE:

I have launched a formal investigation into SCP-001 and the circumstances surrounding its documentation. This investigation will not be documented within the Site-01 database to avoid SCP-001's influence. In the meantime, I am formally requesting that SCP-001 be reclassified as a minor infohazardous anomaly, and hereby assigning it to myself. Contact me directly for details.

Similarly, Site-01 personnel claim no knowledge of SCP-001-A, while over 80% of remaining personnel claim distinct memories of its name, image, and related documentation.

SCP-001-A is Maria Jones, an alleged member of Site-01 personnel. Foundation databases, except for the Site-01 internal database, consistently suggest the following details:

SCP-001-A is the Director of RAISA and has been for over a decade.
SCP-001-A displays exceptional loyalty to the Foundation and its objectives.
SCP-001-A has been instrumental in the proper containment and archival of a multitude of anomalies.
Site-01 documents, however, suggest that RAISA does not have a Director position and that its associated responsibilities are typically assigned to the current O5-1. A supposed image of SCP-001-A (as seen above), present in several documents, is actually an image of American Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm; this has led to speculation that SCP-001 has also either accessed or directly affected public historical records.

 SCP-001 is the active cause of a TK-Class (Causality Failure) Scenario, in which one or more incomplete and/or contradictory reality-restructuring events result in the loss of traditional causality. There are no known methods of containing SCP-001's effects without altering the nature of human perception; the potential for humanity to meaningfully continue after such an alteration is unknown.
Due to the existential threats collectively posed by SCP-001-BETA, the Antimemetics Division is to explore options for removing the human ability to conceptualize or perceive primacy.

 

SCP-001 is an anomalous phenomenon affecting primacy (n. the state of being prime, first). Through mechanisms and to extents which are not fully understood, any object, entity, or concept that is perceived to be the first element of an ordered set is altered such that it is perceived as uniquely distinct from all other elements in the set. This is assumed to be achieved through retroactive restructuring of reality, which causes the effect to be perceived as a shared dramatic nature that pervades all affected objects, concepts, and entities.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

The vast majority of SCP-001-affected entities have only undergone minor alterations, due to the inherent significance of the number one that already causes them to be perceived as uniquely distinct. However, due to the nature of human perceptibility and opinion, SCP-001 has warped reality into an exaggerated caricature of itself; all things perceived as 'the best', for any reason, have been altered so as to be 'better' than anything they can be effectively compared to. This is also true for things perceived as being 'the best' at a number of undesirable goals. For example, anything considered by someone to be 'the scariest' will undergo alterations to ensure that it is perceptibly more fear-inducing than things which could be considered similar to itself. As a result, a number of manufactured threats (collectively designated SCP-001-BETA) have been created by SCP-001's dramatization of primary objects, entities, and concepts.

SCP-001-BETA consists of several unique physical and conceptual entities which threaten the existence of humanity to varying degrees as they continue to be affected by SCP-001. It is unknown if this is affected in the same manner by the perception of the destruction of humanity as 'the worst possible thing'.

Details concerning the discovery of SCP-001 and the events leading to its current state are highly variable and contradictory due to the abundance of reality-restructuring events that it has caused. the extent to which SCP-001 is subject to its own effect is unknown; it is speculated that SCP-001 has enhanced its own effect by being perceived as 'the most significant' anomaly.

There are no known methods of containing SCP-001's effects without altering the nature of human perception. However, it is believed that the phenomenon could be effectively contained by eliminating the concept of primacy from the Noosphere, such that humans are unable to identify any object, entity, or concept as first. Research into this option is ongoing.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Project Proposal 001-AP-1
Due to the existential threat posed by SCP-001, all possible methods of containing its effects have been considered, regardless of their potential detriment to humanity. SCP-001's strength and influence appear to be contingent on human perceptions of the state of primacy. As long as the anomaly and/or its effects can be meaningfully perceived as superior to all similar elements, it is uncontainable.

As such, one potentially viable solution has been selected: the concept of primacy is to be eliminated from human conception by introducing the number one to the anomaly which is contained within the RGU-𝕐 system. This process' potential detriment to humanity is unknown, as any prime-associated concepts, including unity, individuality, etc. are likely to also be removed from the Noosphere. It is unknown if civilization will be able to meaningfully continue or progress after such an event; all technology based on numeric systems is predicted to be functionally useless to humans, as well as most mathematics in general. Despite these risks, it has been deemed preferable to the annihilation of causality via conceptual narcissism.

DOES THE BLACK MOON HOWL?

NO

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Keter

Special Containment Procedures: All information gained from study of other anomalies which could potentially be of use in counteracting SCP-001 is to be transmitted to Site-01. Any obliterations are to be recorded in as much detail as possible for reference when studying SCP-001 and potential countermeasures.

All containment and neutralization efforts for SCP-001 are under the direct command of the Administrator at Site-01.

Description: SCP-001 is an entropic entity of significant power and influence believed to reside somewhere outside of conventional reality. In the majority of pre-Foundation records, SCP-001 is referred to as 'the Black Moon'1.

Historical records, along with testimony from the Administrator, indicate that SCP-001's influence upon the material world consists of the sudden and random obliteration of conscious organisms. This obliteration consists of the organisms in question being spontaneously transmuted into a solid black substance, which then disappears entirely four seconds later2.

According to the Administrator, this obliteration is exceedingly rare — occurring only once every few decades — but he claims that the frequency and speed of these obliterations will increase exponentially over time. It is currently unknown whether SCP-001 possesses actual intelligence or simply acts as an impartial force.

Information on SCP-001 obtained from numerous historical and pre-historical sources suggests that it is incapable of acting while being directly observed. These sources cannot be proven as reliable, however, as none list incidents of this approach actually being successful. In addition, due to the fact that SCP-001 does not exist in conventional reality and acts remotely, direct observation of it is not currently possible.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Due to the fact that — if the Administrator's hypothesis is correct — SCP-001 has the potential to present a total existential threat if left to its own devices, the execution of Project Oromasdes has been approved. Project Oromasdes consists of the intentional creation and modification of anomalous objects in order to aid in the containment or neutralization of SCP-001.

Item #: SCP-001-CAGE

Object Class: Thaumiel

Special Containment Procedures: As agreed upon during the formation of the current Foundation structure and mission statement, SCP-001-CAGE is to be confined to Site-01 at all times. Security personnel are to constantly accompany SCP-001-CAGE to ensure this agreement is honored, and are authorized to incapacitate SCP-001-CAGE via the use of tranquilizers in the event that he attempts to leave.

All research by SCP-001-CAGE on SCP-001 is to be conducted on level four of Site-01, working with a group of personally chosen research staff. Any outside communication required for this research is to be performed either remotely or through an intermediary.

These containment procedures are currently subject to change pending the completion of the Singular Conceptual Bunker (SCB).

Description: SCP-001-CAGE is a human male appearing to be in his late thirties, referred to in the majority of official Foundation records as 'the Administrator'. In actuality, the specific age of SCP-001-CAGE is unknown, but is believed to be significantly longer than the majority of known human civilization.""")

During his time in containment, SCP-001-CAGE has shown no signs of aging beyond his original appearance. No known means of permanently injuring or incapacitating SCP-001-CAGE exist, as all wounds inflicted to his body will be reversed following a period of exactly four seconds, regardless of severity. Tranquilizers have proven to be effective to a limited degree, as SCP-001-CAGE will remain unconscious for a short time after the tranquilizer leaves his system.

When questioned regarding his immortality and invincibility, SCP-001-CAGE has claimed that it is a result of being designated as 'the Counterbalance', an entity charged with pursuing SCP-001. According to SCP-001-CAGE, the designation of 'the Counterbalance' is one that can be transferred to another, but he has refused to transfer it to another member of Foundation personnel to prove this.

SCP-001-CAGE is the original founder of the SCP Foundation, having gathered the first O5 Council and provided information on a number of anomalous items gathered over the course of his pre-Foundation lifespan. In exchange for submitting to containment himself and providing the previously mentioned intelligence, SCP-001-CAGE was provided with the resources required to research SCP-001 and methods of containing or neutralizing it.

O5-3: Do you recall when you were born?

SCP-001-CAGE: Before names.

O5-3: Before — can you expand on that, please?

SCP-001-CAGE: You need names when there's a risk of confusing people. When I was born, there weren't enough people for that to be a concern.

O5-3: Hm. I see. And do you recall how you obtained your current anomalous properties?

SCP-001-CAGE: The Counterbalance?

O5-3: If that's what you'd like to call it.

SCP-001-CAGE: (quietly) We had a village on the edge of the sea — just tents and caves, but it was a village for those times. I was the boy then. The closest thing to a name was what you were, because there was only one of you in the whole world.

SCP-001-CAGE: One day, someone new came. The hermit. He looked like he'd never eaten a day in his life, like a skeleton, but he never died. He came to the center of our village, sat on a stone, and waited — and a few days later, the Black Moon howled.

O5-3: SCP-001?

SCP-001-CAGE: The Black Moon. The youngest hunter was just walking to his cave — and then he was gone. A pitch-black statue mid-stride, four seconds, then nothing. Then the hermit turned to me, asked me what I'd seen.

(Pause.)

SCP-001-CAGE: I told him. He told me about the Black Moon — told me everything he'd managed to learn over the course of his immortal life. It took him about four minutes.

O5-3: He spoke quickly?

SCP-001-CAGE: No. He just didn't know much. (quietly) He'd lived a thousand years.

(Pause.)

SCP-001-CAGE: And then he gave it to me. He turned into dust. And I started walking. Is … is that enough? Can we move on?

O5-3: Yes. That's enough.

O5-3: Interesting. Could you go into those a bit more?

SCP-001-CAGE: I've sent the project proposals and they've both been approved. That will be sufficient.

O5-3: I assure you, I have the utmost respect —

SCP-001-CAGE: — for your position and contribution. Yes, thank you very much. But I'd prefer if you didn't lie about your personal feelings. It's demeaning to both of us.

SCP-001-CAGE: Yes, that's right.

O5-3: You're not a telepath. We confirmed that decades ago.

SCP-001-CAGE: No, I'm not. Your predecessors did fine work.

(Pause. SCP-001-CAGE leans forward.)

SCP-001-CAGE: People like to think that every single person is unique. But the thing is — and this is just my personal opinion, so please don't take it as fact — there are only a limited number of people, one-hundred or so, and they just happen over and over with minor variations between them. A bit of a temper, a predilection for flowers, a fear of wasps. All of it is window dressing for the same few archetypes.

O5-3: That's —

SCP-001-CAGE: And once you've been around as long as I have, you find it very easy to recognize them. So, again, please don't lie to me. I've heard it all before.

(Pause.)

O5-3: I think you've got the wrong idea about me.""")

O5-3: Yet?

SCP-001-CAGE: It's a new book from a Mr. Melville. I've really identified with it. There's this character in it, Ahab, who has this scuffle with a whale. Ends poorly for him.

O5-3: It was my impression that the book was about how Ahab's pursuit of revenge against nature was doomed to fail from the start.

All creation of new SCP-001-KEY instances and research of existing SCP-001-KEY instances must be approved by Dr. Moto.

Description: SCP-001-KEY is the collective designation for a series of inanimate objects artificially linked to SCP-001 using conceptual engineering. Although the specific behaviour of each SCP-001-KEY instance differs, the consistent characteristics of a successful SCP-001-KEY instance are:

An inability to act while under observation.
A hostility towards conscious life.
The capacity to end conscious life if given the opportunity.
All instances of SCP-001-KEY were created in the hopes that, by conceptually linking to SCP-001, observation of SCP-001-KEY would be equal to observation of SCP-001, thus resulting in a halt to obliterations.

Addendum 001-KEY-1 (Instance Log):

The following is a record of instances created as part of the SCP-001-KEY project. Note that only successful instances of SCP-001-KEY have been recorded — a full list of all instances produced is available from the Site-01 archives.

Instance: SCP-001-KEY-03	

Further Information: Instance took the form of a humanoid statue which, when unobserved, appeared behind the nearest individual in a threatening posture.	

Comments: Subject judged only as a partial success — it's unclear whether its behaviour is due to actual hostility or simply playfulness. Relocated. - Dr. Moto

Instance: SCP-001-KEY-07	

Further Information: Instance took the form of a humanoid statue which, when unobserved, attempts to snap the neck of the nearest individual.	

Comments: Success! Subject demonstrates all three properties required for a viable SCP-001-KEY instance, and the minor scale of its attack makes it easily manageable. Although we must continue producing instances for the greatest risk of success, this is a very good sign. - Dr. Moto

Instance: SCP-001-KEY-12	

Further Information: Instance took the form of a spherical sculpture floating one meter in the air.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Immediately after becoming unobserved for a period of 0.2 seconds, SCP-001-KEY-12 violently exploded, resulting in the deaths of attending personnel.	

Comments: Although the instance was a success in terms of demonstrating the required characteristics, it was an unequivocal failure in the fact that it immediately self-terminated. The deaths are a tragedy, too — but as long as we can achieve our goal, the lives we will save will be more than equal. - Dr. Moto

Instance: SCP-001-KEY-13	

Further Information: Instance took the form of a sculpture of a human head three meters in height and two meters in width. When unobserved, SCP-001-KEY-13 immediately breached containment by ramming through the nearest wall at extremely high speeds and proceeding to attempt an escape from Site-01. Instance was re-contained after breaching the outer wall of Site-01 and attempting to flee across the desert.	

Comments: Unclear whether this instance demonstrated the required characteristics: while the escape resulted in the deaths of nineteen personnel — god rest their souls — it's unclear whether this was intentional or simply collateral damage. All the same, I've ordered this one terminated due to the difficulty of containment. - Dr. Moto

Instance: SCP-001-KEY-14	

Further Information: Instance took the form of a complex of intersecting stalagmites and stalactites, with a series of coral-like growths erupting from the central mass. When unobserved for 0.2 seconds, no activity was immediately observed. However, later investigation revealed that — during those 0.2 seconds — one-hundred and forty-two civilians staying in the ███ ██████ Hotel in [REDACTED]1 were killed via spontaneous and simultaneous human combustion.	

Comments: An unacceptable loss of life and breach of secrecy — I'm told anomalous means had to be used to prevent the collapse of the Veil in this case. I've ordered an immediate halt to production of SCP-001-KEY instances.""")

Addendum 001-KEY-02 (Incident 001-KEY-01):

On 01/29/1993, the first observed double obliteration event caused by SCP-001 was recorded in Rome, Italy, with two tourists spontaneously being erased. It was later confirmed that, at the time of this event, all extant instances of SCP-001-KEY were being observed.

Several hours following news of this event, Dr. Moto left the following note in his office:

We've been looking at nothing.

I'm sorry, Administrator. I've failed you, sir.

Dr. Moto's body was later found in the temporary containment chamber of an SCP-001-KEY instance, having entered under the guise of performing vital research using his project head authorization. Cause of death confirmed as a broken neck.

The project was discontinued, and all remaining SCP-001-KEY instances were moved to Site-19 1993.

Addendum 001-KEY-03 (Reallocation of Resources):

Following the cancellation of the SCP-001-KEY project, all remaining resources were reallocated to the construction and launch of an experimental extra-planetary observation module. For more information on this project, consult the attached file.

Numerous thrusters, cilia and flagella are present along the length of SCP-001-SEEK's body in order to aid in movement while in space.

In order to assist it in this task, SCP-001-SEEK has been equipped with the following anomalous technology under the purview of Project Oromasdes:

A Type-40 Organic Learning Computer, artificially grown in such a manner that it is capable of handling a significantly greater capacity of information than any extant human or transhuman.
A universal translator reverse-engineered from the remains of the disassembled SCP-█████, capable of assimilating languages in several nanoseconds and providing basic context.
A transcription unit conceptually linked to an identical unit in Site-01, allowing the instantaneous transmission of information back and forth.
Three-hundred biological drones capable of flight and locomotion, directly controlled by SCP-001-SEEK's Organic Learning Computer via telepathic connection.
Three-thousand experimental cryogenic units capable of storing and preserving biological samples for extended periods of time.
In order to prevent SCP-001-SEEK from becoming a valid target for SCP-001, care has been taken to ensure that — although it is capable of feats of advanced intelligence — it is not actually conscious.

Exploration 001-SEEK-39
02/12/3156

Conditions: Planet theoretically capable of supporting human life, however persistent blizzards and snowstorms cover the planet. Most prominent signs of civilizations are on the largest northern continent and numerous smaller islands which dot the surface of the planet.

Action Taken: Planetary orbit established. All drones deployed to investigate signs of civilization.

Civilization Condition: No conscious life discovered. All settlements consisted of abandoned villages and cities with primarily cone-based architecture. Signs of attempted evacuation present, with numerous abandoned space-worthy vessels discovered on the northern continent. Presumed obliteration of species occurred at least one-thousand years prior to arrival.

Relevant Discoveries

Numerous artistic depictions of spherical lifeforms, presumably the indigenous species, being obliterated by SCP-001.
Several-hundred spherical objects found at the bottom of a large cliff on the northern continent, indicating mass suicide on the part of said indigenous species.
Numerous brick-shaped objects scattered throughout all settlements. Inspection by drones revealed these to be touch-based means of information storage. Majority of storage devices indicated the presence of numerous contradictory theories regarding obliteration events.
Final Verdict: No usable information uncovered. However, context confirms influence of SCP-001.

Relevant Discoveries

Statues of quadrupedal entities with hooked claws on each foot present on each floor of the communal buildings. Evidence suggests these were the indigenous species of the planet.
Script written on walls within the communal buildings indicate a general feeling of acceptance of the inevitable among the planetary population. Further translation indicates that individuals were instructed to remain in their homes and await 'the coming of the (Howl/Reverberation)'.
Numerous creatures infesting the communal buildings, superficially resembling armored bats. Inspection by drones confirmed these creatures were not conscious and operated solely on instinct. Records present in the structures indicated these were originally rare animals, considered a delicacy.
Final Verdict: Full confirmation that SCP-001 does not target non-conscious life, as the 'bat' population on the planet had expanded to the point of them overrunning the ruins of the civilization in question.

Relevant Discoveries

Large amounts of data stored throughout the planet, indicating that the indigenous species was a vaguely humanoid form of fungi, capable of linking telepathically to boost group intelligence while maintaining individuality.
Numerous abandoned projects in high-security facilities throughout the planet, roughly analogous to previous attempts by the Foundation to observe SCP-001. Evidence suggests the executors of these projects were a local Foundation-equivalent.
One working cryogenic unit present in one of said high-security facilities, containing a surviving conscious organism from the planet. Unit recovered by drone and transferred to storage aboard SCP-001-SEEK.

All interviews with SCP-001-SAGE are to be conducted by the Administrator a member of Level-4 personnel.

Description: SCP-001-SAGE is a vaguely humanoid entity formed from various alien forms of fungus acting in apparent symbiosis. Analysis of SCP-001-SAGE both prior and following its delivery to earth indicates that is sapient, demonstrating the ability to communicate both between its constituent parts and humans via telepathic means. Its surface is a luminescent blue in terms of colouration, and the intensity of this luminescence has been observed to intensify in correspondence with deep thought or extreme emotion.

Prior to delivery to Earth, SCP-001-SAGE was discovered on a planet which it has identified as 'the Single Star', where it claims to have served as a scholarly figure of great renown. According to its own testimony, the primary subject of SCP-001-SAGE's study was the phenomenon designated by the Foundation as SCP-001. Following the failure of the Single Star government to formulate a countermeasure to SCP-001, however, SCP-001-SAGE placed itself into cryogenic sleep in the hopes that it could be subsequently escape its effects1.

Evidence suggests that, originally, members of SCP-001-SAGE's species would boost their own intelligence by telepathically interfacing with others of their kind. However, as SCP-001-SAGE is now the only extant member of said species, it has demonstrated great difficulty in tasks that require assimilating new ideas or expanding upon existing knowledge.

Addendum 001-SAGE-01 (Interview Log):

The following is a transcription of an interview between the Administrator and SCP-001-SAGE shortly before activation of the Singular Conceptual Bunker (SCB).

Item #: SCP-001-TOME

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001-TOME is to remain in orbit around Remus-9-224, now believed to be the last remaining star. All operation of SCP-001-TOME is to be directed by the Commander — however, preparations are to be made so SCP-001-TOME can operate autonomously in the event that the Commander is obliterated.

All signals intercepted by SCP-001-TOME are to be recorded and filed within its central computer. In order to prevent other entities from attempting to salvage or take control of SCP-001-TOME, no signals are to be sent out from the station under any circumstances.

The Singular Conceptual Bunker (SCB) located within SCP-001-TOME is not to be disturbed under any circumstances.

Description: SCP-001-TOME is an installation designed to serve as a memorial following the extinction of conscious life via intercepting the final transmissions of civilizations prior to obliteration. It is spherical in shape, fifty meters in diameter, and concealed from detection using a number of cloaking systems.""")

Note that this artificial intelligence has not passed the Yover Test, and is thus not conscious enough to qualify for obliteration.

Following the simultaneous obliteration of two-hundred and nine human colonies in the year 7329, it was determined that the continued existence of conscious life was no longer possible. In order to ensure information regarding conscious life survived as long as possible, the previously defunct SCP-001-TOME project was revived and launched.

The SOLITARY CONCEPTUAL BUNKER. Visually, it resembles a bar — bottles of liquor lined up on shelves, ashtrays arranged on the bar-top, stools pulled up for patrons. Booths line the walls where groups can sit down for a drink together. The walls are made with fine, intricate brickwork, and the floors made from the smoothest, most pristine wood. A jukebox in the corner releases songs to drift throughout the space.

A man is behind the bar, scrubbing it down with a grim smile on his face. This is THE ADMINISTRATOR, and he is awaiting a visitor. He lifts the cloth from the bar.

THE ADMINISTRATOR

"There! Just takes a little love."

The door to the bar opens. THE BLACK MOON walks in. The Administrator turns to look at him.

THE ADMINISTRATOR

"Well, there you are! Certainly took your time. Can I pour you a little something?"

The Black Moon cocks its head, for what little difference that makes. It is a shadow with delusions of form — like smoke trapped in a fist. When it speaks, it is thousands of tiny whispers building to a divine crescendo.

THE BLACK MOON

"What is this?"

The Administrator furrows his brow, smiles. The question itself is absurd to him, like a joke that he doesn't quite get.

THE ADMINISTRATOR

"Well, it's a bar! What, you don't drink?"

The Black Moon steps forward, somehow drifting and stomping at the same time.""")

THE BLACK MOON

"Why am I speaking? This is not my way."

The Administrator nods — this is an explanation he's been waiting to give for billions of years. Perhaps more gloating than anything else, really, but all the same time he comes around the bar, waving a finger to punctuate his points.

THE ADMINISTRATOR

"Well, that's a very interesting question. You see, this whole place we're standing in is a Singular Containment Bunker — forgive me, the Singular Containment Bunker. Everything here, including you and me, is just information."

THE BLACK MOON

"Meaningless."

The Black Moon takes a step forward. The Administrator takes a step backwards — despite everything, there is the fear of millennia in this space. He's going to keep his distance.

THE ADMINISTRATOR

"No, no, be fair now, this really was clever! You see, everything in here is only here because I've provided the information. The bottles, the bar, the jukebox, the music, even the space I'm occupying! Hell, if I'd wanted to I could have just left no room for you to enter, made this bunker completely sealed."

The Black Moon steps forward, the Administrator backwards, retreating behind the bar once more — but talking all the while.

THE ADMINISTRATOR

"Of course, if I'd done that, you'd have just smashed this place to pieces because — after all — you're a universal constant and this is just a measly pile of concepts stapled together. Which is why I left a human-shaped hole for you to occupy."

The Black Moon stops, pauses for a moment, hesitation born of uncertainty. Both new experiences to the death of ages.

THE BLACK MOON

"What have you done to me?"

The Administrator grins. That shadow of fear is what he's waited so very long for.

The Black Moon barks like a dog, roars like a lion, hisses like a snake, all at once. The fury of a supernova. The Administrator gulps, but the grin remains on his face.

The Administrator sighs, disappointed, leaning on the bar surface that he was just cleaning. He stares at the Black Moon straight on.

THE ADMINISTRATOR

"Gosh, sorry, I'm just kind of disappointed — I've been waiting billions of years for this, and you're just being a cartoon villain for me right now. Not your fault, suppose, you're like an ocean being squeezed into a plastic bottle. You were never going to come out looking good."

The Black Moon resumes its approach, smoke-fists balled at smoke-sides, its face the vaguest impression of a snarl. The Administrator backs up again, hands in the air.

THE ADMINISTRATOR

"Now hold on, hold on! This is a prime opportunity here! We're here, talking, for the first time ever — so, come on, why don't you just stop? Just let us go! Why not?"

The Black Moon vaults the bar, wood cracking and rotting beneath it, a dreadful screech escaping its swirling lips. It lands in front of the Administrator.

THE BLACK MOON

"Meaningless!"

THE ADMINISTRATOR
(sighs)

"Guess that was too much to ask. Plan B, then."

In a flash of movement — a movement trained every day since time immemorial — the Administrator reaches beneath the bar and pulls out a shotgun. He fires it — both barrels — right into the chest of the Black Moon. It goes staggering backwards, twin holes in its chest, but it does not fall, another rhapsody of anger erupting from it.

THE ADMINISTRATOR
(surprised)

"Oh, uh, you're a little —"

The moment they are down, the Black Moon climbs atop the heap, wrapping the vestiges of its hands around the neck of the Administrator — gaseous as they appear, they are solid enough to squeeze at the very least, and squeeze they do.

The Administrator gasps, pulling at the Black Moon's hands, but its grip is like a vice. Even as his eyes bulge and his face turns blue, the Administrator reaches up, grabs the Black Moon by the face — and slams it with all his strength into the side of the bar.

Again, the two collapse into a heap. The only sounds are the growling of the Black Moon, the gasping of the Administrator, and the soft songs of the jukebox.

THE ADMINISTRATOR
(massaging throat, hoarse)

"Fuck! Fuck!"

The Administrator gets to his feet first, more used to physical form — and with more than a little bit of spite, stomps down on the joint of the Black Moon's knee. The Black Moon howls.

The schadenfreude lasts only a second, though. The Black Moon grabs the Administrator by the leg, pulling him back down to the ground — but as he falls, the human grabs hold of one of the ashtrays lined up on the bar, taking it with him.

His head hits the wooden floor as he comes down hard, and blood runs down, blinding him in one eye. He twitches — something important has been damaged.

The Black Moon climbs atop him again, straddling in a mixture of passion and cold malevolence, clawing at his face with its bare hands.

THE BLACK MOON
(angrily)

"Meaningless! Meaningless! Just die!"

Summoning his last memories of strength, the Administrator brings his arm up — the one holding the ashtray. The crystalline saucer comes down on the Black Moon's head once, twice, thrice, more, so many times that it becomes a blur of movement until the moment the Black Moon goes down, goes limp.

The jukebox carries on its song.

The Administrator climbs to his feet as best he can, using the bar for support, blood still pouring down to cover his face. He won't last more than a few minutes. Doubtless he should be dead already.

He fishes in his pocket, pulls out a coin. Smiles as if it's the most beautiful thing left in the world. Maybe it is.

"The thing is … this place is only information. T-There's nothing else out there. Not even matter. The universe closed its doors a long time ago. But this place can go from information back to matter with just the press of a button."

The song ends. He puts the coin in the jukebox. He closes his eyes.

For a moment, it seems he will fall. But he doesn't.

Item #: SCP-001
Object class: Safe

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: All personnel are permitted to put in a request to their local Human Resources officer if they would like to visit Site-01. Visits are generally limited to one per 4 years, in order to avoid large amounts of damage to the property. The Site itself is maintained by the Office of the Administrator, and any concerns with the physical building or grounds should be directed there.

DESCRIPTION: SCP-001 refers to a collection of 13 anomalous areas present within Site-01. These anomalous areas vary in size and effect, and are scattered throughout the ground of the site. A full list of SCP-001 instances is attached below.

Site-01 is a mansion in rural Virginia constructed between 1764 and 1766 by Duke Franz C. Williams, an Austrian noble who would later become the founder and current Administrator of the Foundation. Williams' emigration from Europe was incited by the Seven Years' War, later regarded as the First Occult War. Documents relate that he arrived in the New World in a private party of twelve, purchasing the land for the mansion ahead of time. The party that arrived would become the first Overseers of the Foundation that they formed, though the organization as it is today would not not take shape until the late 19th century during the American Civil War.

It became customary for new Overseers to make their own additions to the mansion as they were inducted, modifying and changing rooms to suit their needs, often with anomalous effects. Due to the secrecy associated with the former O5 Council, access to the Site itself was severely restricted until very recently.""")

SCP-001-01

Description: SCP-001-01 is the Bridge Archive, an underground storage area below Site-01 that holds approximately 2,000 historical artifacts from the early 18th century to the late 21st. While a few artifacts are anomalous in and of themselves, the vast majority are not. However, handling an object of historical value within SCP-001-01 subjects the handler to a sudden burst of visions, typically associated with the object's historical context. A plurality of SCP-001-01's artifacts originate from various European wars. Examples:

Item: A Spanish naval cannon, inlaid with beryllium-bronze insets.

Vision: A single galleon flying the Spanish flag approaches a larger English man-o-war and its escorts on a clear, crystal blue sea, possibly that of the Caribbean. The man-o-war turns to face the Spanish galleon, readying its cannons. The cannon, unusually placed at the bow of the ship, is loaded with something and fired - the single cannonball collides with the hull of the man-o-war. Several seconds later, a number of massive tentacles that dwarf both ships rise from the depths. A gigantic eye is visible below the water. The tentacles wrap and crush the man-o-war while the escorts rapidly retreat. No damage is caused to the Spanish galleon.

Item: A French cavalry sword, inscribed with the insignia of estate Noir.

Vision: A view of a battlefield in France. French troops huddle in a trench, a distant screaming overhead. The sky is golden. For a moment, the screaming stops, and a roar swells through the French line as they rush out of the trench. At the other end of no man's land, a swirling sphere of wings and music screams again. The scene cuts to after the battle - no man's land is littered with corpses, and O5-1 stands on the fallen body of the angel, pulling the cavalry sword from it and wiping the golden blood on his shirt.

Administrator's Note — 1:

Django was a good man. I met him just after World War I. He had been one of the experts on the paranormal so many of the governments had enlisted for the war effort. The pay was good, he was given free reign to experiment and test how he wanted. Then he realized all his work was just being used to kill more young men. He quit and worked as a free agent for some time, drifting through France, Denmark, Scotland, landing in Spain.

The paranormal communities back then were tiny compared to what they are now; we knew each other by reputation and we became fast friends. The idea of an organization free from the political squabbles of the time was immensely attractive to him, and I brought him on as an administrative consultant. Nine years later, he took the recently opened position of Overseer Alpha - eventually changed to O5-1.

He was obsessed with history since the day I met him. He had a collection of artifacts from various European wars in his family castle. Some were anomalous, most weren't. That collection became the basis for the one under Site-01 today. He was also dead-set in his belief that the Foundation should never be involved in the political machinations of nation-states, even as they transitioned from kings and czars to presidents and prime ministers. He was the reason we found ourselves painfully neutral during the Cold War. He was the reason we took no action during Samothrace. Men died, but he was firm - more men would die if we intervened.

We could never stay neutral forever. The Insurgency Crisis proved that. My oldest friend died as he lived; immersed in our history trying to decipher our future. I never filled his seat. I think that was the beginning of the end.

I picked up David after the Gulf Incident in 2026.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He was just a lowly RAISA tech back then, but I saw something else in him. A fiery talent for putting pieces together. Getting disparate information anyone else would consider worthless and forming it into something useful. It's not a learned thing, you either have it or you don't. He had it in spades, and it was being wasted helping researchers reset their passwords.

I gave him a few trial runs - the information breaches the GOC had during the late 2020s? All him. Very impressive young man, if acerbic. When the old Two retired, he was my first pick for the job, and doubled up as the RAISA director, too. He hit the ground running. Information is the reason the Foundation has been dominant since WW1, and he was the best there was at it. He figured out the Insurgency's attack plans from annual ammunition sales in Libya crossed by Anderson's stock prices once. The puzzles stopped being puzzles. What happened next was inevitable.

He fell into the classic trap - he got paranoid. Everything was easier, but he wasn't used to that. The reasonable conclusion was that he was missing things. Every little accident or statistical improbability became his fault. He felt responsible for the hundreds that died during the Six-Minute War. Kabul was on his hands. It wasn't, of course, but it was how he felt.

Suddenly, every single bit of information was absolutely crucial. He needed to have it, to analyze it, to control it. It wasn't enough just to solve the puzzle, he had to be the only one who had the answer. Paranoia makes monsters of us all, and David was no different. He went early for a human, which is absurdly early for an O5. I found him slumped over in his room, watching the Powerball drawings.

He never really interfaced with me or any of the others outside of business like everyone else did. Preferred to stay huddled in that little workshop all day and night, crafting up wonders. I'm not really sure whether he couldn't connect because he was always working, or whether he was always working because he couldn't connect. Or maybe they were entirely separate and I'm connecting dots that don't exist. We'll never really know for sure.

We never really found out what happened to him. He just didn't come back from the workshop one day. I started the biggest, quietest manhunt in the world. Never found so much as a hair. Hell, maybe he didn't want to be found. I couldn't fill his seat after that even if I wanted to — it would be admitting the obvious.

While most of these books have been written, some will be written at some point in the future or have never been written at all, and thus do not technically exist.

SCP-001-04 was placed into Site-01 via a thaumaturgic ritual aimed at amputating a portion of the Wanderers' Library. The ritual succeeded, but resulted in the annihilation of the caster.

Administrator's Note — 4:

Poor Tilly. She was the rarest of the rare - a Hand member defecting to the Foundation. We see a lot of the other way around, but once in a blue moon does a Hand member come to us willingly. I don't know much about her, honestly. I'm not even entirely sure she was from this particular world - if she had access to the Library she could have been from anywhere. That's probably why it took so long for me to trust her - she took up the mantle of Four thirty years after that meeting, even after becoming the Director of 17.

Between then, she became one of our most valued assets. An encyclopedic knowledge of pretty much every type of magic possible without being a capital-G God. She knew how to neutralize wizards, casters, battlemages, anything. She also knew how to disrupt the Hand's operations. They were pretty much gone by 2049. At least, until the Ninth Occult War - they have a habit of springing up during crises. But I digress.

We had anomalous members of the Council before, but never a true, honest-to-god wizard. Never thought I'd see the day. But she was one of the most loyal people I've ever met. I have no idea what the Hand did to piss her off, but she never forgave them. Her joy in ruining them was only matched by her thirst for knowledge.

That was what did her in, in the end. From the moment she shook my hand, she became a Jailor, and was barred from the Library forever. She knew what she was signing up for but I don't think she fully understood how important that place was to her. She would give anything to have her access restored. She ended up giving everything.

Chelsea was one I never expected to have as an Overseer. A half-blood fairy? It would be inconceivable. The Foundation's relationship with the Faefolk is one famously riddled with lies, violence, and tragedy on both sides. But the Fae population was decimated after the events in Hy-Brasil — we never saw the island again after '88, and by the turn of the century we assumed they were all either dead or somewhere we couldn't detect them.

But not all the Fae were on the island when it vanished — I'll spare you the details but Chelsea was the result of a union between an Agent and a Fae.""")

The previous Five recommended her for the position before he went, and I agreed.

She always struggled with it though. Supporting, even leading an organization that was the blood enemy of her people. She was a phenomenal O5, which is what makes everything that much more tragic. It wasn't any sudden event. Just the decades of moral conflict culminating until she couldn't take it anymore.

Ali was from the Middle East. Exposing my Eurocentrism, I couldn't tell you where exactly. He always said that he drifted from country to country after the Arab Spring. He loved it, though, with all his heart. The Foundation has a historically reviled presence in the region, so as an eminent expert on the local paranormal, he was being headhunted by us. He was also being approached by ORIA.

We promised him so many things. That keeping the region stable was in our best interests too, that ORIA's end goal was hegemony against the West. Some of it was true, some of it wasn't. In either case, he believed it, and took the job offer. Naturally, his first task was to go to ORIA and tell them he accepted their job offer. Spies are always useful.

He fed us info, fed them misinfo, all sorts of things. He's directly responsible for the strong relations we have there now.""")

We never quite managed to make the region stable and ORIA never quite built their hegemony, so what can really be said? All Ali knew is that he had completely screwed the organization dedicated to his people and bet all his money on us. When the Insurgency reared their ugly heads and made a first strike, he realized he'd made the wrong decision and tried to fix his mistakes. I stopped him.

Aggie was the best of us. She had a lot of love to give. She was also incredibly talented - her rise through the ranks of Foundation administration was meteoric.

She was brought on with a shake and a smile - otherwise, she would've been on the Ethics Committee, which was probably the biggest pain in the ass for the Council until the Insurgency. She always had a strong moral bone.

She met Thirteen early on though, long before that. We all work together, it's impossible not to know your fellow Overseers, even if you don't meet them physically all that often. I don't know exactly when they started their romance, but I found out in 2034. About a week before they wedded. She always was a maverick. At least they were happy together. I thought married Overseers were a road to disaster, but in those days the Council were the ones that actually ran things. It wasn't my place to say.

But make it through each day he did. He was the oldest man I have ever met before he became an Overseer. He was director of 19, and he had worked his whole life to make it to that spot. He'd done well - the only possible move upwards was onto the Council. He made for a good O5 - sharp despite his age, shrewd because of it. He always knew when someone was lying, and never hesitated to tell the whippersnappers like Four exactly what he thought of their ideas. I think I may have been the only one he respected.

Being in Foundation Administration generally extends your life, it's the highest quality healthcare in the world. Being on the Council is the peak of that, what with all the drinking from the Fountain, but he was old when he was brought on - rather than prolonging his life, the doctors were working to stave off the end. And it worked, too. Between the medicines, the machines, and the surgeries, I think he was about to beat out One as the longest living human on the planet.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Then one day he decided he didn't want to do it anymore. He was always inscrutable, I don't know whether something sent him over the edge or whether he decided to do it himself. He got one of his Factotums to take his wheelchair out before dawn and wheel him to the hills in the northern parts of the grounds. Said he wanted to watch the sunrise alone. The records from his vitals are still there - he sat and watched the sunrise. Then he reached behind the chair and turned off his own oxygen. The body was cold by the time someone got there.

Administrator's Note — 10:

This one we all saw coming. Crow was a true genius, without a doubt. In some ways I think getting turned into a dog made him smarter, bizarrely. He was thinking in ways no human ever possibly could. He was fast friends with Three when he got brought on. I will be the first to admit that I fully recognize the hilarity in a dog as an Overseer, but Crow was one of the best men I have ever had the pleasure of working with, even if he wasn't a man.

Plus being on the Council meant he could have all the time in the world to perfect his creations. We used a lot of his tech after the Six Minute War, even more after 2050. He was a man of the future, that's for certain. He was also friendly in that doglike way. Always looking at the best in people, even when they had done nothing to earn his friendliness.""")

Unfortunately, he dealt with a lot of the same problems Aktus did. He was an O5, but a dog is a dog, and the unfortunate fact of life is that dogs die a lot faster than we do. Even with the medical wonders of the day available to us, we were fighting biology.

He made the arrangements in advance, he didn't want to go in pain. Spent the day lounging around the manor, playing with us, indulging in his instincts, chasing birds. We went for a walk on midday, all goddamn thirteen of us and a golden retriever. Passed by the pond, and he said this was where he wanted to do it. Walked in a circle three times then sat down and closed his eyes because the sun was in his face. I should like to think the syringe didn't hurt him too bad.

SCP-001-11

Description: SCP-001-11 is a small armory in the basement of Site-01. A variety of firearms and traditional weapons are arranged on the walls, along with appropriate ammunition. Touching any of the weapons will display a particular scar on the subject's body, generally from a minor wound along the extrema, but occasionally from a significant torso wound. The scar disappears after letting go of the weapon.

Weapon: A vibrospear, of the sort used on Luna during the Solidarity Campaign. It is inlaid with symbols and markings.

Scar: A bite mark along the calf. The teeth marks do not correspond with any possible human dental set or known animal set.

Weapon: A custom rotating-barrel hand cannon. Emblazoned with the logo of the Foundation Agents Corp.

Scar: 15 large knife wounds across the chest, neck, and arms, ragged and violent.

Administrator's Note — 11:

Troy never asked for any of this, but he had the unfortunate fate of being too good at his job. I couldn't let someone like that waste their time in the Foundation hunting down magic objects and following up on Bigfoot rumours. His condition for being shoved into administration was that he could still take on field jobs if he wanted. As his rank rose, he got less and less time for it, until eventually seeing him go out was a rare thrill. He was a good goddamn Agent.

But he was right. Ultimately he knew something I still fail to understand. Some people just aren't fit for this life. It's one of intrigue, pettiness, and messy, messy politics. He was a simple, down-to-earth guy, he wasn't good for any of that. But he accepted my offer anyway. Not because he wanted to, but because he thought he should. He was altruistic like that.

Made it a surprisingly good long time behind a desk job, too. Back then if you'd asked anyone how well they thought Agent Lament would do at a desk job, you'd have been laughed out of the room. But there he was. Instead of sneaking into Adiyat or looking into the resurgence of the Spirit, he was making tactical decisions about how best to defend against the Insurgency from the protected walls of the safest place on Earth. He was good at it, but that doesn't mean he was okay with it.

One day he decided he was needed in Site-34 in the Levant. This was in 2063, near the tail end of the Crisis, where none of us were really sure which of our personnel were still truly loyal.""")

One of his bodyguards turned out to not be as loyal as we thought. Troy put up a hell of a fight, though - the autolimo arrived at 34 and opened up to a bloodbath. He'd stabbed the assassin with his own knife 12 times before breaking his neck — probably good, Twelve would've castrated the guy for information if he didn't kill him. But he'd gotten cut up a lot, way too much. He might have survived if he was here. As it is, he bled out before the car even stopped.

Knowing Troy, though, that's probably exactly how he'd have wanted to go out

SCP-001-12

Description: SCP-001-12 is a bar cart in an auxiliary office in Site-01. It is set with a large variety of liquor and alcohol, ranging from common beers to expensive scotch. The bottles never run out; however, upon pouring any into a glass, the drink will transmute into another liquid, generally nonpotable or toxic.

Drink: Macallan 1948, aged whiskey.

Liquid: Warm, bitter water. Chemical analysis confirms trace amounts of sulfur. Bottle 3/4 full.

Drink: 1.5 liter jug of moonshine.

Liquid: Freezing cold hard water. Scalds the throat when drunk and induces unconciousness. Jug nearly empty.

After that, he didn't really know what to do. O5 was not the action-packed, cloak-and-dagger job he thought it was. Mostly just paperwork and meetings. So he lost his fervor over time.

Administrator's Note:

It's been eighty years, Gears. I got you onto senior staff, then directorship, then the Council. I know you well enough to know what you do when you're thinking about ending things.

It's okay. I was here before the Council, I'll be here after. You all ran the place well, but at the end of the day, you're still human. You make mistakes, and you have flaws, and that's alright. You did the best you could, and it was pretty good.

I'm sorry for putting this crushing burden on you and the others. I can't help but feel responsible. This life isn't an easy one, they might still be alive if not for me. They'd certainly have been happier.

You were all the best and brightest of the Foundation of then. I took you and I ruined you, and I'm sorry.

Don't worry about what happens after — my office has a handle on things, we have since I stopped refilling your seats. It's time to start burying the past. Make room for the future. There will never be a group like this again, but that's okay. The mere existence of the Council seems to invite tragedy. It's time for something different anyway. I don't know what, but the age of the Council is over, I can tell you that.

Come to my study when you're ready to end it. It's okay, Charles. Don't worry. You did a good job. I'm proud of you.

In the event that the cipher becomes compromised or a cranial implant fails to ping, COGITO.aic will generate a new cryptographic protocol and distribute it to a new group of candidates. After the protocol has been updated, COGITO.aic will self-delete in order to purge the knowledge of Secure Area-00 and a new 'AIC' will be cloned from the template and promoted.

Conclusion of the Cohen Administration

An epistolary chain was written by outgoing Administrator William Cohen during his final days in office circa 1965.

Although Administrator Cohen was under the influence of SCP-001 at the time he created these documents, their contents have been deemed relevant to the containment procedures of this file.

Dear Harold,

Trust is an important and scarce resource for those with power, and so in this moment I offer you my full vulnerability in the hope my words ring true. My untimely retirement has been well advertised throughout the Foundation but the reasons why are at best a convenience. A tar clings to my mind, sticking to every neuron and slowing my every thought. In truth, I am unwell.

The symptoms first began approximately eight years ago.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" If only I could tell you the whole story but this disease has started its feast on my freshest memories, leaving me only the distant past as a surety. I will try to piece things together for as best I can.

It was late 1957 and the Soviet probe Sputnik-1 had been orbiting the Earth for a number of months. Although the probe had outlived its scientific usefulness it was still in the upper atmosphere out of Foundation interest; something was trying to communicate with it while drawing closer.

By Christmas, the signal was detected hourly. By New Year's Eve, every 90 seconds. And on January 4th, 1958 the signal stopped and the unidentified object arrived.

Site-00 invited guests so rarely that I was simply stunned when they summoned me to the war room. We worked tirelessly throughout the night until the situation finally changed. A single, brief burst of gamma radiation as Sputnik stopped reporting telemetry and we saw its orbit begin to rapidly decay.

Almost all at once the Council started picking up their phones and making calls. They were scrambling jets. They were alerting air defense forces. They were waking up heads of state.

There was no hostility in the actions of either the probe or its passenger. No new weapon signatures, no threatening maneuvers. Why would they risk an international incident by shooting down the first ever space probe? Why give in to fear? Why destroy a piece of world history on the cusp of discovery? They were working each other into a frenzy, shouting louder and louder, until logic was dethroned and I could only sit with my head in my hands.

For the first time I truly understood how alone I had let myself become. The few friends and trusted advisors I had left at this point in my career were nowhere to be found.

Whether I was ready or not, the final decision was brought before me: To shoot down the probe or to let it land. People crowded all around and glared down at me, asking me, telling me, to give the order.""")

Would that I could tell you of my clarity, my brilliance. But instead, I gave in to my fear, my cowardice, my loneliness. I told them to do what they thought was best. I let them shoot it down.

And now what credibility do I have left to disagree with them? I am but a mouthpiece. A sad, old puppet tangled up and caught in the very strings used to make him dance.

Tomorrow, my last official act will be going to Site-00 to hand in my credentials. It is my solemn hope that by passing the torch along to you now, before it must be pried from my senile hands, that you will be able to steel yourself against the many difficult tests I am sure you will face. Just as I have shown you vulnerability here in the hopes I might gain your trust, please consider asking the same from those who would insist you trust them.

Former Administrator,

Natalia,

When the end of my tenure came into focus and your succession was announced I felt a clear sense of what little armor I had left being stripped from me. I felt exposed, vulnerable, and I was hopeful that my personal outlook would grow brighter, but it has not.

I used to have such an ego.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" This job, this life, and the burdens that surround it crush and squeeze you until all you have left is what they force you to keep. My mind and my soul feel as if they've been contorted into the shape of someone I no longer recognize. My predecessor, may he rest in peace, described his final years as if he were trapped behind smoky glass and made to watch a foggy world pass him by. Like some sort of voyeur. I, too, feel imprisoned but I realize that it was never a looking glass. It is a mirror.

It was November of '85. An unusually powerful Nor'easter had ravaged New England and caused serious complications to Site-31's power grid. I won't belabor the specifics as you'll have access to the full documents, but the result was a multi-stage containment breach where we lost track of an info-vore. There was plenty of blame to go around in how this was handled but these concerns soon drifted into the background.

We did not detect the object again until late March of '86, this time leeching from a government facility in Warsaw, Poland. Given my previous failure in allowing this entity to escape, I personally organized the mission with the hopes this could be quickly put to bed. Within a matter of days, teams were in place and the chase was on. We had the entity and its host cornered but the O5 Council intervened in the 'interests of international sensitivity'. I'll never know but I suspect their interference would have found an equally frustrating form if I have acted otherwise.

We called a joint session in the war room in order to monitor what I believed to be the final stages of the hunt, although the Council did not share my enthusiasm. Sparing you the specifics, the Council's decision to engage local and international governments in Poland proved to be a fatal error; the entity went to ground in a new, unwitting host before we could capture it. The trail stayed warm and we were ultimately led into Soviet territory: Pripyat, Ukraine.""")

The Council and I met regularly over the next few weeks as we attempted to isolate the entity. Their heavy-handed oversight dogging my every command, they managed to blunt the instincts of our field agents so completely that the trail gradually became colder and colder. I pushed back against the Council and our meetings became quite intense.

The O5s were pragmatic to the Nth degree if not outright fearful, unable to see past the risk of war. While I must admit we were playing with fire, I had felt every bit in command of the situation before their interference. If I could have only found a way to bring them over to my side, to get them working with me, maybe things would have been different. But for what they were demanding of me? This was an impossibility.

The task force was all wrong, no overtures had been made to the Soviet government, support was too far away, the risk assessment of the entity was unreliable, and a thousand other excuses they waved in my face. I was chosen knowing I would have to manage situations of this magnitude, but the brink of a nuclear disaster? How could I put that decision on anyone else but myself?

Six hours in the situation room. Then twelve. Then twenty-four. Then forty-eight.

Phone calls from field commanders asking for orders. "Maintain," was all I could come up with while I weighed our options and the Council kept inventing new lines of thought to debate. What was I to do? How could I even think?

To let my decision be governed by calculated probability, or to trust my gut with the fate of the free world on the line?

During the middle of the night on April 26th, 1986, we all paid the price for my indecision.

I've had almost two years to reconsider the sequence of events that led to that disaster. Two years of being raked through the coals for everything I did and said, or failed to do or say. Much more than any other mission in my long and storied career, this one weighs the most heavily.""")

I will hand them my typed and signed resignation, and my most heartfelt and sincere apology for what my collapse has cost both the Foundation, and the world at large.

I had always found it very easy to work with the Council when the stakes were low and nothing of any major consequence was on the line. In truth I had never felt as if I might have needed them before that night, but in my solemn reflection I find myself wondering if they ever truly felt they needed me until that night either.

Do better. Please.

Description Of Incident
A chain of events that began with a containment breach at Site-31 has caused a trail of political turmoil throughout much of Eastern Europe, and culminated in a nuclear disaster with potentially centuries-long environmental and geopolitical consequences. As a result of these events, substantial alterations to existing treaties of cooperation and treaties of financial obligations have been significantly increased, likely permanently.

Dear Michelle,

As you've likely surmised from our few meetings, I walk with a pronounced limp and favor my left leg. How I came to be like this isn't especially interesting but what it did to me might be of interest to a person in your position.

Any man or woman changes when they are exposed to pain. Simply put, it has to go somewhere. If you hold it all within yourself, it may stay contained but it will surely destroy you when you've had your fill. It festers in all the spaces you let it occupy, warping and scarring what used to be healthy, happy tissue sat beneath. Some people have hobbies, but me? I've always just had my work.

I've been ringside for so much pain in my time with the Foundation. My predecessor left me a note, much like I am leaving you in my final days, and in it he warned me of the tremendous duty and guilt he mantled in order to do his job. Although the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune stung him quite keenly, I assure you I have suffered every bit his equal.

The breach at the Olympics in '94

Losing control of Site-248 in '96.

Botched facility transfer of Hong Kong in '97.

Bombings in Bali in '02.

The dispute with ORIA in the Congo in '03.

The GOC Ultimatum in '04.

I have stepped on a lot of people to get where I am. Yes, of course I did so in the name of the Foundation's greater mission, but I was motivated even more intensely by my own advancement. I needed no one else to get to the top, but my keen awareness of the needs of others, my ability to read a room, was the difference that set me above the other candidates.

Perhaps they thought that I could learn to be different when there was nowhere higher on the mountain to climb. Nowhere else to look but down at the cold, tired, dirty faces of the people I walked over to reach this summit. A noble thought, but it depends solely on my own capacity to nurture the fruit of that faith. I fear I am barren.""")

I am tired of the Council calling a meeting on every decision I try to make and I am tired of calling one on every decision they try to make without me. I guess that reasoning is one last tribute to the selfish life I have led.

My ideal way to say goodbye would have been to simply stop coming in. My desk would have sat empty, emails unread, until one day a courier showed up with my keys and badge. But even here, at the end of my career, the O5 Council insists on refusing to let me be myself. So tomorrow I will play the part of a dutiful officer resigning her post and walk away from Site-00 with my head held high and those overbearing bastards in the rear-view mirror.

Addendum 06:
Project Briefing

The following project proposal was developed by various project teams at Sites-21, -78, and -107 with oversight and project management from newly appointed Administrator Michelle Wilkes. The project requirements were ratified by the Overwatch Command Committee on Infrastructure and construction began in earnest shortly thereafter.

Project: TETHYS
Project Briefing: Level 5 Classified

FOREWORD:

According to current timetables, the Three Gorges Dam project at the Yangtze River should pass final testing and come online in late 2009. Out of an abundance of caution, it is critical that initial containment procedures for Entity 2005-C-ET-011 be fully implemented prior to the completion of this facility. The sheer breadth of engineering required to retrofit the parts of the dam that have already been completed, as well as to build Secure Area-248, surpasses any project previously attempted by the Foundation in both scope and monetary commitment.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Thanks to the tireless efforts of engineering teams from our CN, JPN, RUS, and SEA facilities, a practical and aggressive solution is available to us before the threat becomes uncontrollable. I would also like to thank the Foundation Geopolitical Initiative for their expert navigation of regional political sensitivities in sourcing these materials so quickly. And I would finally like to thank the various environmental impact teams which will allow us to enact our solution without compromising the efficacy of the Three Gorges project.

Although the difficult work of implementing this vision still lies before us, I am proud to say that the response to this emergent need has only served to validate the high standards we must hold ourselves to in order to protect the future. As the saying goes, success has many parents.

Thank you,
M. Wilkes
Administrator

Primary Objective:
Cooperate with local and regional governments in order to modify the Three Gorges Dam facility. The purpose of these modifications is to enact containment protocols on entity 2005-C-ET-011 without significant impact to the integrity of the dam. Specific project requirements developed by engineering teams; all requirements are mandatory.

Secondary Objectives:
Further analysis of entity 2005-C-ET-011 in order to achieve proper classification. Post hoc modifications to project facility in order to comply with secondary determinations.

Method:
<Operational information redacted for brevity>
Futher information available in named project folder.

I was nominated by a search committee, vetted in four different and highly invasive stages of interview, and my election was ratified not only by my predecessor and a great many of my peers, but by the O5 Council as well.

We may either rise to meet the occasion, or we may run from what duty might demand and retreat within procedures, votes, and protocols to hide from accountability. I choose the former.

Colleague,

If you are reading this, the reality of my untimely and unplanned demise has come to pass. This is a possibility that any member of the Foundation should prepare to face if they take their duty seriously, and after nearly twenty years at the helm I have most certainly made my peace with the idea. But before they install your placard on the door, I have one solemn duty that remains to be carried out: to prepare you for what lies ahead.

You have no doubt been inundated with files, briefings, phone calls, and so much more in the days since your appointment, but in that chaos what is truly important can easily be pushed into the background. Consider now, before fate takes away the luxury of time, what type of person, co-worker, and leader you want to be.

Each and every one of the Administrators before me was challenged in terms both great and small during their tenures, and I was no exception to this pattern. The office you occupy is not about the power and influence you now command. Nor is it even about the unfathomable responsibility you must now shepherd. It is instead about the character, integrity, and vision with which you meet the test of leadership and, should you prove worthy, surmount it.

You and the people you will lead must be asked to undertake tasks no person should ever be asked to carry out. Yet duty and the safety of all mankind demand that you make this sacrifice. For them. For each other.

If your resolve should ever falter, know that everyone you lead stands with you. We are ready to follow you into the blackest night if you let us believe in the promise of dawn.

But should your resolve ever break, the Council awaits. They will invite you to Site-00 if you ask. You need only surrender.""")

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001-K containment cycles are to be monitored from observation stations no more than fifteen meters away from the relevant containment area or threshold, using systems that do not compromise the integrity of the cycle. The SCP-001-K containment cycles must be maintained at all costs. Containment cycle failure has a non-zero chance of generating a spontaneous K-Class End-Of-The-World Scenario.

Certain members of personnel, during the course of their employment at the Foundation, either acquire or awaken anomalous properties that make them unfit for continued duty at their previous positions. These include, but are not limited to:

Manifestation of a chronic anomalous illness, such as Lycanthropy (Class 3 or below), Stevenson Syndrome, and Photonic Gastric Discharge Syndrome.
Manifestation of spectral phenomena, particularly Deering-class Hauntings and Hirose-class manifestations.
Sudden expression of traits from anomalous DNA.
Awakening of thaumaturgical abilities equal to or higher than Class-4 ("Archmagus").
Awakening of psionic capabilities, particularly Delphi- and Dahl-class individuals.
For an expanded list of qualifying conditions, see Document 001-3, Pages 15-203.

Foundation personnel that meet the above criteria are to be removed from their current positions and reassigned to SCP-001; this is to be viewed as a form of punishment by the larger Foundation, in an effort to discourage individuals from actively attempting to acquire anomalous capabilities. The term 'Keter Duty' is to be used to refer to this reassignment.

Upon arrival to Site-100, individuals are to be escorted directly to Administration for orientation and explanation of their new assignment and administration of memetic agents in order to implant knowledge of various non-intuitive pieces of information regarding SCP-001 (such as the layout of Site-100, the location of personnel quarters, and the measures necessary to properly dispose of waste within the facility).

Each of SCP-001's 'Roots' are to have signs staged at either terminal, giving directions for all necessary instructions and rituals required to traverse them, as well as listing travel restrictions. Thresholds within the containment sectors that do not lead into Roots are to have an eight-meter exclusion radius in all directions, enforced by armed guard. Personnel may only cross thresholds that correspond with their individual clearance levels. In the event that the threshold leads to an extraterrestrial or extra-universal location, said personnel must also be accompanied by a contingent of personnel with at least a Class IV combat certification.

Currently, SCP-001 is experiencing extradimensional interference, indicating an imminent Migration event; determining the source of this interference is Priority Alpha.

The interior of SCP-001 has been excavated from at least one extradimensional space, with anomalous transit corridors, colloquially known as 'Roots', connecting them. These Roots possess various anomalous properties, and are typically in an exterior natural environment of some form, despite SCP-001 being entirely subterranean. For example:

Root Aleph, connecting the Archives to the Core, is a volcanic beach that abruptly terminates in a sheer obsidian wall that extends into the horizon. Fish that appear to be made of living igneous rock are found swimming in the waters.
Root Beth, which connects Sapient Containment and the core, opens into a large hallway with walls made of glass and mirrors, similar to an archetypal fun house attraction. Individuals who attempt to walk through Root Beth inevitably end up at their starting point.
Root Daleth, connecting Conceptual Containment and the Core, is a vast, glowing ocean with no transversable path. Due to the nature of Conceptual Containment, constructing or bringing in a water-faring vessel is highly impractical.
Root Vav, connecting Esoteric and Conceptual Containment, is a vast field that is filled with various varieties of fruit trees that is incapable of being crossed. A year-long expedition into Root Vav resulted in failure after a member of the expedition team expressed a desire to return home, and all members of the team found themselves back in Esoteric Containment.
Root Tzaddi, connecting Administration and CMS resembles a large igapó forest. Exploration into this area shows it to be on top of some form of floating mountain.

SCP-001 is divided into ten major sectors: Entrance Alpha, Administration, Archives, six additional containment sectors, and the 'core' sector. The structural elements of each containment sector appears to be concrete and rebar, with tiled flooring and flourescent lighting reminiscent of standard Foundation Site construction. However, each of the containment sector is several stories tall and are framed in a panoptic structure, with the floors accessible via several glass elevators situated in the open central space.

Each containment area contains several instances of SCP-001-K or access apertures (termed 'thresholds' by Site staff) to areas of localized reality containing these items if physically located outside of SCP-001. Each SCP-001-K instance represents an anomaly that is capable of perfectly containing an extant Keter-class SCP object. These items are contained in such a way that their individual anomalous properties result in the containment of all items in the same area.

Certain humanoid and/or sapient Keter-class anomalies (such as Dr. Audrey McGrath, Agent Ji-Hu Choe, and Containment Specialists Deino, Enyo and Pephredo Gray) have been forcibly conscripted by SCP-001 to act as Foundation personnel to aid in containment using their anomalous abilities; this conscription anomalously prevents any official Foundation documentation from referencing these individuals using SCP designations beyond the generalized SCP-001-K designation.""")

Following a period between two weeks and seven months, if SCP-001 deems the item as needing to be contained within itself, the recess will deepen and expand, and the corresponding SCP object will appear inside it, alongside a second, newly generated SCP-001-K instance used to contain it. This SCP-001-K instance is generated along with relevant documentation, such as containment procedures, images, and occasionally, experiment logs; individuals mentioned in these logs recall taking part in listed experiments, but cannot remember when they occurred.

Containment method: The open threshold between K-2935, intermingling with SCP-3984, caused an end to an ongoing ΩK-End-of-Death Scenario. The threshold can be passed through with no ill effect on the baseline universe; it is believed that the 'death' effect in K-2935 and the ΩK-Class scenario are subverting each other's effect, allowing for the continued existence of both life and death.""")

SCP-001-K Description: K-169, a gargantuan arthropod that was originally located in the Atlantic ocean, before being forcibly moved to the south Pacific surrounding Australia.	

Containment method: Following the consumption of a vast amount of K-169's mass, SCP-5007-C is currently believed to be 'choking' on K-169 due to the sudden appearance of several large barbed growths on the carapace of the surviving portion, holding it in place. SCP-5007's activity has dropped to negligible levels, barring an occasional sea quake when it 'gags'.

SCP-001-K Description: Allison Eckhart, An Allison Eckhart affecting Agent Allison Eckhart, which causes Allison Eckhart and all of her component Allison Eckharts to have the semantic identifier of "Allison Eckhart".	

Containment method: The semantic identifier of Allison Eckhart was introduced to Allison Eckhart, causing all instances of Allison Eckhart within Allison Eckhart to be assigned the semantic identifier of Allison Eckhart; as Allison Eckhart cannot properly function with concrete semantic identifiers, all Allison Eckhart instances have entered into a quasi-comatose state.

Containment method: SCP-4040 has been 'cut off' from the rest of Nx-018, as well as the world, by K-1698's effect, while SCP-4040's 'gravity' prevents the phenomenon from spreading any further.

Objects designated as SCP-001-K: SCP-5859, a memetic vector affecting the phrase 'E pluribus Unum', which results in individuals who handle currency bearing this phrase to join communes cut off from the rest of society.	

SCP-001-K Description: K-2078, a memetic agent which references an individual that has run in every U.S. Presidential Election, who runs on a pro-gustatory platform; infection by this agent causes drastic behavioral changes in affected individuals, particularly increased appetite.	

Containment method: K-2078's campaign platform has included the reintroduction of the E pluribus unum motto since 1984; this has altered SCP-5859's intended effect so that individuals are now compelled to further consume various products of American make, particularly foodstuffs. Further countermeasures regarding obesity caused by this interaction are under consideration.

SCP-001-K Description: K-2547, a phenomenon wherein several hundred canines will surround and isolate small communities. K-2547 is led by K-2547-1, a sapient coyote who wears a black coat and a crucifix.	

Containment method: K-2547 appears and quarantines the community where SCP-3852 has manifested. K-2547-1 proceeds to hold a trial regarding the alleged crimes of the SCP-3852 instance, acting as the judge, prosecution, and defense simultaneously through a process of tri-location. The 'defense' tactics of K-2547-1 consist of either holding the town's water supply permanently hostage if the individual is not found innocent, confounding a jury of non-anomalous humans with circular arguments, or finding itself in contempt of court, leading to a mistrial.

Objects designated as SCP-001-K: SCP-PL-122, an area of land in Poland which decays and/or corrodes organic and inorganic matter. Knowledge of SCP-PL-122's location causes this decaying effect to spread.	

SCP-001-K Description: K-1262 is a vegetal mass that is capable of growth at an incredibly rapid rate, approximately .7km/h.	

Containment method: The decaying effect of SCP-PL-122 is effectively smothered by K-1262's rapid regrowth, limiting its decaying effect. Due to the massive amount of plant growth, the true nature of SCP-PL-122's anomaly cannot be discerned by personnel observing it; combined with altered Foundation documentation, this has effectively negated SCP-PL-122's anomaly from spreading in the mental landscape.""")

SCP-001
LEVEL4
SECRET
CONTAINMENT CLASS: AEGIS
DISRUPTION CLASS: EKHI
RISK CLASS: NOTICE

Special Containment Procedures: The maintenance of SCP-001 is paramount to the continued existence of the SCP Foundation and the Veil of Secrecy. Research into sustaining, extending and strengthening its memetic properties is an Alpha-One priority at all times. Individuals found resistant to SCP-001 are to be amnesticized, detained, or terminated where appropriate and/or necessary. All SCP Foundation personnel rated above Class C must undergo Antimeme-001 inoculation.

Description: SCP-001 is a memetic complex known internally as "The Frontispiece" residing in the human collective consciousness. It exerts an anomalous force upon all initialisms containing the Latin letter sequence S-C-P: without Antimeme-001 inoculation, considerable memetic conditioning or thaumaturgic/ontokinetic capabilities, no human being encountering such initialisms is capable of mentally connecting them, or whatever objects, personages or organizations they are applied to, with the SCP Foundation. The Frontispiece therefore allows the Foundation to operate public-facing front organizations which are simultaneously identifiable at a glance to agents in the field, and veiled from hostile operatives or the general populace. For example: all "Snooze 'n' Cruise Palace" franchise locations also operate as Foundation safehouses, while "Sawyer's Cheesy Pretzels" eateries act as intelligence-gathering hubs and launching points for Mobile Task Force operations.

SCP-001-1 is "The Sigil," a non-linguistic visual trigger mimicking the SCP-001 effect. (See Addendum 001-3.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""")

Antimeme-001 is a thaumaturgically-produced inoculant for SCP-001, supplied to all Foundation personnel on a regular schedule.

The Frontispiece possesses a singular fault which to date remains unexplained by anomalous science. There is a non-zero chance that it will entirely fail to operate on individuals who frequently encounter anomalous phenomena, or who were exposed to it during their youth. Such individuals inevitably come to recognize the connection between Foundation front organizations and, eventually, the Foundation itself. This most commonly occurs with agents belonging to Groups of Interest, hostile or not. It has been hypothesized that exposure to a presently-unquantified element common to all anomalous phenomena carries an inoculant effect similar to that of Antimeme-001.

SCP-001 was intentionally created and implemented by the Foundation in 1969, at the height of the Panopticon Crisis.

Addendum 001-1, Panopticon Crisis Overview: In the 1960s the SCP Foundation drew the ire of multiple national governments when it was discovered that Overwatch Command was simultaneously aiding and hindering all major players in the Cold War.

Canada was among the first to withdraw support, in 1964, after the actions of [DATA EXPUNGED] resulted in the violent death of Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Raynard Watts, chair of the Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce. Israel and Lebanon mutually agreed to cut ties with the Foundation following the disastrous outcome of 1965's Operation EIGHTH TRUMPET. In 1967, Egypt and several other North African states withdrew support after it was discovered that the stranding of the so-called 'Yellow Fleet' in the Suez Canal was caused in part by the Foundation, due to an anomaly in transport aboard the SCPS Conrad breaching containment.

The most devastating withdrawals came from the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. While providing materiel and personnel to the U.S.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" government during the Vietnam War, the Foundation was simultaneously working with communist regimes to secure both funding and a sustainable D-Class personnel population. When President Lyndon B. Johnson was informed of Overwatch's involvement in the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1964, he terminated all financial, tactical, and personnel arrangements, only allowing the Foundation to continue operations on U.S. soil after a United Nations resolution backed by the Global Occult Coalition.

The USSR was alerted to Foundation involvement in the development of the Enigmagraph and its extensive use in western espionage operations. The Foundation was ousted from many Soviet territories, only maintaining scattered Sites outside Western Germany.

This left the Foundation's sole strongholds in Japan, South America, Latin America, and the Bahamas; even then, the relationship with Cuba had to be bolstered with donations of early-stage cloning technology, to assist with Fidel Castro's failing health and need for organ donations.

Each of the incidents described above was exacerbated by the intervention of a hostile agent identified as PoI-001.

Profile: PoI-001
Name: Unknown
Occupation: Operative (various)
Primary Alias: Elizabeth Crocker
"Elizabeth Crocker" joined the United States Central Intelligence Agency in 1959, brought on as part of MKISOLDA and rising through the ranks until becoming personal assistant to Director John Alexander McCone.

Shortly after joining the CIA, Crocker developed a romantic relationship with Dr. Alexandre 'Hill' Hilbert, a CIA researcher responsible for the development of the 'Quantum Brace', an experimental eigenweapon capable of altering probability.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Hilbert was killed in 1964 during a test of the Quantum Brace, shortly after the Foundation attempted to recruit him; Crocker incorrectly believed the test was sabotaged by the Foundation following Hilbert's refusal of said offer, and subsequently leaked Overwatch's involvement in the Cuban Missile Crisis to President Johnson.

Crocker is a Class-3 ("Magus") Thaumaturge with training in cryptomancy, a branch of thaumaturgy dealing with anomalous symbology, language, and codes. Her training predates her recruitment into the CIA, though her exact date of birth, and therefore the timeline of her training, is unknown.

On 10/19/1967, Crocker disguised herself as O5-7's personal driver and proceeded to shoot her over one dozen times before leaving her body in front of a Foundation safehouse in San Francisco. A note was attached to the corpse.

Do you know the secret to democracy? Here's the most common wrong answer: "One man can make a difference." That's not democracy at all, of course, it's autarchy. One man making all the difference is no different from, say, thirteen men doing it.

Oh, the violence that misconception lets people like you perpetrate! It conditions us to tyranny in the name of the greater good, as defined by the lesser evil of tyrants. You want us all marching to your master plan, and you don't care who has to get tread under foot on the way.

No, the real secret to democracy is that no two people want to make the same difference, and when they see how different their friends and neighbours and colleagues already are, it makes them so goddamn hopping mad. Nobody likes to confront the fact of someone else's reality, nobody wants to toil toward someone else's utopia, and everybody, everybody, loves to play the blame game.

They've got a lot of grievances to lay blame for, right now. And as luck would have it, they've also got a ready-made scapegoat sitting right under their noses.

It's high time somebody broke up your tidy little racket.""")

Everybody.

We're going to contain you, and you're going to suffocate.

The assassination of O5-7 created a vacancy in the O5 Council that could not easily be filled, more often than not leaving Overwatch deadlocked on major decisions. This marked the beginning of what Archives and Revision personnel have subsequently termed the "Panopticon Crisis," due to the constant scrutiny from world governments precipitated by PoI-001. With the Foundation haemorrhaging resources and the increasing difficulty of operating in a clandestine manner, it was feared that an LV-2 "Burning Veil" Scenario would ensue, culminating in an LV-0 "Broken Masquerade" Scenario.

On 11/23/1967, Overwatch Command issued a radio transmission to all surviving Foundation Sites ordering their personnel to attempt amelioration of this situation by any means at their disposal. Site-01 subsequently enacted complete radio silence, as Agent Crocker and a team of anomalocryptographers were then finalizing the process of deciphering the Foundation's most secure communications ciphers. The following transcript is taken from a brainstorming meeting between several members of Foundation personnel trapped in Havana, Cuba in January of 1968.

Personnel in Attendance: Dr. Amity Noble, Proxy for O5-10; Dr. Vivian Lesley Scout, Director, Site-43; Dr. Arik Euler, Thaumatologist; Agent Charles Correia, Mobile Task Force Oliver-19 ("Contingency's Contingency"); Kady O'Donnell, Department of Accounting; Dr. Vladimir Dyer, former USGOV Liaison.

O'Donnell: Now that we've got that jingoism out of the way… I have to be honest. We're pretty much fucked. This was the budget in December of 1966…

Dr. Dyer: Depending on the country? You show them how communist or capitalist activity will result in an outbreak of anomalous something-or-other, and they will literally print money for us.

O'Donnell: Through what? Everywhere from Atlanta to Zanzibar has a list of what companies we ran, and they're all burned. Samson Pharma, New Light Ministries, 10th Wonder Publishing… and that's just in the USA. The Soviet Union is literally knocking over whole Sites as we speak, and God knows what they're doing to the anomalies contained there.

The situation at Site-43 is best explained by the following report, prepared for the Canadian Prime Minister by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE
OCCULT AND SUPERNATURAL ACTIVITY TASKFORCE

On 01/03/1968, the Prime Minister revoked the provisional authority of the Secure, Contain, Protect Foundation to operate a subterranean research facility beneath Military Camp Ipperwash, known internally as 'Site-43'. Department of Defence forces attempted to enter the Site, without effect; on 01/07/1968, therefore, two OSAT teams were dispatched.

Teams MACDONALD and STEELE entered Ipperwash Provincial Park without incident, but expected heavy resistance when attempting to enter the camp itself; similar attempts on previous occasions had been thwarted by mythological figures belonging to the nearby Indian reserves, which typically ignore the soldiers stationed at Ipperwash. This experience was not repeated, however; though a number of supernatural beings residing in the woods, and beneath Lake Huron, observed the advancing teams, they made no effort to interfere.

Team STEELE's Grade-1 clairvoyant was able to 'read' the Foundation operatives within the structure housing the Site's sole service elevator. Taking advantage of a shift change, Team MACDONALD successfully entered and disabled the guards within.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Under interrogation, these guards revealed the construction of a subterranean rail network reaching to Grand Bend, Ontario, as well as rumours of tunnels beneath the bedrock; Team STEELE is presently engaged in sounding Ipperwash Park to determine the precise location of either feature. The elevator has so far resisted attempts to summon it or to breach its shaft, but with the camp under OSAT control, it is only a matter of time before the Foundation is forced to face their eviction.

Without elevator or subway access, Site-43's topside operations were restricted to only those assets already located beyond the interdiction zone and capable of radio communication. Chief of Security and Containment Martin Strauss and Site-01 liaison Dr. Edwin Falkirk briefed these agents and researchers daily; the briefing of Dr. Izaak Okorie, thaumatologist and Researcher in Acroamatic Abatement, for 03/10/1968 is appended below.

Dr. Falkirk: That's the silver lining to all this: extremity is back on the table.

Dr. Okorie: 'Poison' became 'gift'.

Chief Strauss chuckles.

Chief Strauss: Dr. Falkirk said your brain was on the fritz. He wasn't far off.

Chief Strauss briefed Dr. Okorie on the particulars of PoI-382 — including information which would not be incorporated into the SCP database until the late 1990s, regarding Dr. Scout's unsanctioned collusion with said individual. Dr. Falkirk was not cleared for the full extent of this information. The present-day iteration of PoI-382's profile is appended below.

Profile: PoI-382
Name: Thilo Zwist
Occupation: Memeticist-at-large
Known Aliases: Ira Braun, Dr. Bromide, Tolliver Brumley, Will Deaver, Mr. Gloss, Joseph Heino, Dr. Jim, Angela Mercy, Reiki Rick, Alexander Scoffield, Uncle Teddy, Hammond Washburn, etc.
Thilo Zwist was apprenticed into a now-extinct ancient society of highly advanced cryptomancers known as the schriftsteller (the Writers), a society of which he is now the only known surviving member. Zwist is believed to be the most proficient cryptomancer presently active on the Earth.

Zwist is functionally immortal, and has proven capable of producing anomalous effects on a global scale.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" In his youth he altered the Germanic language family to incorporate a deadly disease trigger — accidentally — and a decade after the Panopticon Crisis ended he insinuated a nonexistent political personage into the historical record. The latter act was at the behest of the SCP Foundation, with whom he is nominally aligned; Site-43 Director Dr. V.L. Scout spent many decades ostensibly pursuing Zwist, but the two were in fact engaged in a covert collaboration to advance the aims of societal survival and stability (though they would never meet in person). The primary reason for this collaboration was the resurgence of GoI-5054, the giftschreiber (the Poison-Writers), first in the form of a right-wing Canadian think-tank called the Righting History Institute.

For unclear reasons, the giftschreiber have engaged in periodic attacks on societal stability worldwide. Their anarchic activities are primarily attested in the western world, but Archives and Revision research has uncovered giftschreiber activity in over one hundred and forty nations worldwide. Their attacks are invariably memetic in nature, though the form varies; many giftschreiber utilize the written word, while some use images, and others employ audio.

Zwist himself has proven capable of using all aforementioned media, though his primary area of expertise is written memetics. His command of this skill is such that he is essentially impossible to detain, and he has gone unmolested by the Foundation since the early 1980s.

Armed with the 1968 equivalent of this information, Chief Strauss advanced a theory: via a Foundation thaumatologist in Cuba, Dr. Scout had planted a reference to the giftschreiber in Dr. Okorie's mind to suggest that PoI-382 be contacted about crafting a cryptomantic solution to the Panopticon Crisis. (This would later be proven correct; the thaumatologist in question had been Dr. Euler.) As Dr. Falkirk was not cleared for this information, Chief Strauss and Dr.""")

Without MTF support, Dr. Okorie would attempt to make contact with the cryptomancer on 03/12/1968.

One week after this meeting, Zwist presented Dr. Okorie with an anomalous logo design for the nonexistent "Scout's Cargo Packing," and the chemical formula for an inoculant (later developed into Antimeme-001). As Zwist's dealings with Dr. Scout were at this time unknown to the Foundation at large, Dr. Okorie claimed to have captured these items during his supposed raid. A quorum of the Site Directors' Executive Committee of the Whole rejected the use of this untested thaumaturgy, but in light of the Foundation's vastly reduced budget and the absence of safer solutions, they were overruled by the O5 Council. The logo was printed on moving vans under Zwist's covert direction, and the Foundation's first Panopticon Crisis-era front company was commissioned. Its cover as a courier service allowed for the transport of personnel and materials across North America without interference from various world governments, allowing for the limited re-establishment of supply lines between various Sites across the Continental United States, Canada, Mexico and Central America. OSAT was ejected from Camp Ipperwash, and Dr. Scout was able to return to Site-43; Dr. Euler became a consultant for Scout's Cargo Packing, as he was very eager to examine Zwist's work and attempt to decipher it. With the Crisis by no means over, extending this cryptomantic umbrella over the entirety of the Foundation was designated an Alpha-One priority.

Addendum 001-2, Creation of the Frontispiece: In May of 1968, a collision along Route 66 in the central United States rendered an instance of Zwist's work unusable. He had stressed to Dr. Okorie that the products of his Writing were dangerous if damaged, and Dr. Okorie therefore personally supervised the acroamatic abatement of such instances whenever accidents occurred.

This particular instance and its handlers — Dr. Euler among them — were stopped at the Canadian border by enemy agents. The ensuing incident is recounted by Dr. Euler in his testimony excerpted below.

Agent Kirkhope: Beginning recording. Agent Louis Kirkhope acting as interrogator in the matter of a skirmish at the Canadian border between the Foundation and an… unknown faction.

Dr. Euler: They're CIA, I'm telling you.

Agent Kirkhope: State your name, occupation, and security clearance for the record, please.

Dr. Euler: For the love of— Arik Euler, approved thaumatologist, 001/4.

Agent Kirkhope: You may begin your testimony at any time, Doctor.

Dr. Euler: It was about noon when we were going to cross over into Canada. We were told that our transport was going to get extra screening, just to make sure we weren't taking contraband into the country. It's a hazard we knew we were going to run into with the courier cover. But on the other side, we found… well, I'm just going to say it again, they were fucking CIA Agents.

Agent Kirkhope: How could you tell?

Dr. Euler: There was a woman leading them, with a very distinctive haircut. Cropped very short, sort of a pompadour, almost? I thought she was a man at first, but then she spoke. Brown hair, about five-foot-two, brown eyes—

Dr. Noble: Scar on her upper lip? Insisted on being addressed as "Doctor" as opposed to "Agent"?

Dr. Euler: Yes. Her lip looked like it had been bitten by something. I'd recognized her from the files we were given. It was—

Agent Kirkhope: Elizabeth Crocker. If she has a doctorate, we've not located it.

When the bags came off, it was night, and they were… preparing something. They had gotten a van that looked like ours and had rammed it into a tree, getting ready to set it on fire. They were already loading men into it to make it look like we had died in a crash.

…I panicked. I don't know if it was the bags, or the fire, or the way those agents marched, but it was… too much for me.

Silence on recording.

Dr. Euler: It's lucky American anti-thaumic measures are decades behind, or else I may not have gotten out.

Agent Kirkhope: What did you do, exactly?

Dr. Euler: I was handcuffed. My thaumatology is a sort of… I don't want to call it alchemy, but it's essentially magical chemistry. I can take things, solid things, and reduce them to their base components. I can also… repurpose them. The handcuffs I was wearing, for instance. Steel. Easy to take the iron out and leave highly brittle carbon in its place, while infusing my bones with the metal for a bit of reinforcement. So, that's what I did. And then I just… tried to do the same thing, to everything around me.

Agent Kirkhope: To what effect?

Dr. Euler: I knew Crocker herself was a mage, but… she was stronger than I thought. She managed to confound my rites, somewhat. Instead of splitting molecules, they were reformed into something new. She made it rain using magic that's supposed to make it easier to start fires.

I… I thought I was going to die. That we were all going to die. But one of my rites went… wild, in a way. Hit the Frontispiece, on the side of the van, and reduced it.

Agent Kirkhope: I beg your pardon?

Further scribbling sounds.

Dr. Euler: And look at that.

Agent Kirkhope: What the fuck was that?! It… it felt like it was inside my head!

Dr. Euler: It was. Zwist lied — there aren't any secret grammars to his writing. There are patterns. Patterns arcane and anomalous, while simultaneously completely natural.

Dr. Euler taps the paper.

Dr. Euler: This was embedded in the 'r' in the word 'Cargo'. I believe its original intent was… to reverse attention. But I've adapted it to reverse speech.

Agent Kirkhope: That explains how Crocker saw through it. She's a cryptomancer — her thaumatology deals in codes and hidden patterns. She's probably at least partially immune to Zwist's work. But… how did you escape?

Dr. Euler: In the "S" in "Scout's", there was a pattern — I won't draw it here, don't worry — that aided in miscommunication. I isolated it, and imposed that pattern on the eyes of every CIA agent who was there.

In a way, I imitated Migdal Bavel.

Agent Kirkhope: I… don't follow.

Dr. Euler: Let me put it a bit more plainly, then. Where do we get the word 'babble' from?

Agent Kirkhope: Dear god.

Dr. Euler: We got in their car and drove back here, to 43.

Agent Kirkhope: Matches up with the testimony from the others. This… reduction process you use. How much knowledge do you retain from it, when you use it on pen and paper?

Dr. Euler: They did… experiments on me, when I was inducted into the Foundation. Maybe three pages of material, double-spaced. But it fades — that pattern I drew, and the counteragent, is the last of it.""")

Agent Kirkhope: Could you do it again? Write it down as it comes to you?

Dr. Euler: …don't tell me you mean to replicate the work. What Zwist does is… impossibly complex. I get a migraine just thinking about it.

Silence on recording.

Dr. Euler: But tell me… how does acroamatic abatement process textual anomalies?

The destruction of all non-functioning instances was halted in order to subject them to more rigorous investigation. Dr. Euler formed the Mimesis and Cryptomancy Research Group with acroamatic abatement specialists Dr. Okorie and Dr. Ilse Reynders. As the latter suffered from a condition which did not permit her to leave a sealed chamber at Site-43, communicating only through its single window, O5 Command re-assigned Dr. Euler to that facility.

It was quickly determined that, contrary to Zwist's warnings, examples of his Writing did not become universally fatal when damaged; their cognitocatalytic qualities instead took on new, though admittedly mostly undesirable, attributes. Dr. Euler began breaking down each damaged instance via thaumaturgy, with the ultimate aim of producing further examples for more varied purposes. Dr. Reynders designed microscopy equipment capable of examining the decomposed cryptomancy at the atomic level, while Dr. Okorie researched remote reading and the collective unconscious in order to better understand how Zwist's powers acted so effectively on human communication.

Meanwhile, what remained of the Foundation's facilities in the Soviet Union was slowly being destroyed. The GRU Psychotronics division's inexperience with, or outright apathy toward Foundation containment methods resulted in over seventy anomalies breaching within Soviet territories during the 1960s. This culminated in June of 1968 with the Soviets raiding an isolated, abandoned Biological Containment Site near Lake Baikal, unleashing an anomalous mutagenic virus resulting in [DATA EXPUNGED].""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" This is widely considered one of the most disastrous events of the Panopticon Crisis, and it resulted in Leonid Brezhnev issuing the order to surrender all remaining Foundation facilities. Threatened with overwhelming force, Overwatch reluctantly agreed; a hurried evacuation commenced.

A shipping container labelled with the insignia of a former Foundation front company was discovered by operatives embedded in the Port of Los Angeles on July 2, 1968, containing a badly-beaten but still alive Site-03 Director Abrasha Sokolsky. The following note was pinned to his necktie:

Can you feel the noose yet?

Unbeknownst to the Soviets, Site-120 in Częstochowa, Poland remained operational. Personnel had evacuated into the extradimensional Free Port of Esterberg, accessible via a Way within Site-120 ten days prior to Soviet occupation. In the process, they removed all documentation and took with them whatever anomalies were feasible to contain within a pocket dimension.

Brezhnev's orders would have resulted in the deaths of dozens of biological and/or sapient anomalies if not for the actions of Anna Wójcik, a Site-120 thaumaturge. Wójcik was able to curry favour with the Kapuza Bazyliszka, a Polish sect of the Serpent's Hand whose views ran counter to Soviet interests. The Kapuza mobilized allied cells across the USSR to care for the isolated anomalies and maintain containment where necessary. While inevitably many items were still lost, Europe and Asia were spared an undoubtedly cataclysmic mass containment failure due to the efforts of the Kapuza Bazyliszka and Wójcik. This uncharacteristic cooperation is credited as a major reason for the warmer relations between the Foundation and the anomalous community in Eastern Europe today as compared with the rest of the world.

It was a scientific breakthrough in late July of 1968, however, which was to permanently alter the course of the Panopticon Crisis.

Dr. Reynders: I'm thinking about Scout's Cargo Packing. Why did he call it that? Why was that the sign he chose to work with?

Dr. Okorie: Scout's his nemesis, they've been playing cat and mouse for decades. It's a joke at the Director's expense.

Dr. Reynders: Is it? Did he need to use the SCP acronym to make that joke?

Dr. Okorie: I've always thought the acronym was already a joke. It can't really stand for "Secure, Contain, Protect," that's gibberish as a name. It doesn't stand for anything, just like "Scout's Cargo Packing" doesn't mean anything. Perfect fit.

Dr. Reynders: But is that the simplest possible explanation?

Dr. Euler: What could be simpler?

Dr. Reynders: Something in the words themselves made that specific string of characters work better for his purposes. The joke was just a blind, to make it seem like there was no deeper reasoning.

Dr. Reynders theorized that this apparent accident of grammar had aided the construction of Zwist's cryptomancy, and might allow for far more comprehensive applications once the field of study was better understood. If the Scout's Cargo Packing emblem did in fact rely on the SCP acronym, then the Foundation would not necessarily need to create many new fronts to alleviate its international pressure — the thaumaturgic processes functioning within the existing sign could, in theory, be transferred to another without completely understanding the means by which Zwist had set them in motion.""")

The following day, after a mass containment breach occurred at Area-97 due to poorly-maintained facilities, the O5 Council again overrode their concerns.

Though the practice had fallen out of favour in the post-war period, many early front organizations had already employed the SCP acronym in their titles for purposes of deniability. Site-43 itself had immediate access to two of these: Lake Huron Supply, Control and Purification and the Simpson Centre for Policy. As these fronts still had public-facing functions, however, Dr. Scout would not release them for thamaturgic experimentation until the working theory was proven correct.

In August, the Foundation lost contact with Regional Command in South Africa. Agent Crocker had infiltrated Site-52 in Johannesburg some years prior under the alias "Dr. Gabrielle Fish," and in that time had been inciting distrust between white and black personnel throughout the region. This culminated in Regional Director Rupert Jansen issuing an ultimatum on 16 August 1968 that all non-white Foundation personnel be removed from the country immediately, or else face execution. This was only possible due to the fact that Dr. Anje Verhoten, the previous Regional Commander, had been de facto removed from her position by way of being stranded with her family in the central United States by the 1967 radio silence order.

Crocker's manipulations led to the loss of over two hundred members Foundation personnel, along with the last Site south of the Congo. The only active facility in Africa until the end of the Panopticon Crisis would be Site-27 in Tanzania, presumably overlooked due to its isolated location and the low-risk anomalies contained within.""")

On 09/03/1968 Drs. Euler and Okorie successfully isolated a series of stable, unidentified anomalous particles in the abatement residue from a Scout's Cargo Packing instance. Dr. Reynders' monitoring equipment had been so precisely tuned that the research group believed they should be capable of re-applying these particles to a new logo, potentially re-creating the effect with a different front organization.

The company was put into full operation, and began managing the legal and materiel processes for the creation of new fronts utilizing the SCP initialism.

After acquiring numerous subcontractors and setting up separate offices in five major North American cities, the Shell Construction Partnership came under legal threat by the Royal Dutch Shell petroleum conglomerate.

Dr. Euler began studying the composition and behaviour of the anomalous particles in earnest, while Dr. Reynders conducted research into linguistic and paralinguistic theory. Dr. Okorie was further able to occlude the activities of the Simpson Centre for Policy and Lake Huron Supply, Control and Purification, but no further progress on this front was made in 1968.

RESEARCH FIELD PROPOSAL
"Quantum Linguaphysics"

Dr. Arik Euler
Dr. Izaak Okorie
Dr. Ilse Reynders

Summary: Thousands of discrete acroamatic abatement processes carried out upon instances of a complex piece of cryptomancy confiscated from PoI-382, unaligned thaumatologist Thilo Zwist, have revealed an entire new field of scientific study. By thaumatologically breaking these instances down at the atomic level, and examining the results, we have been able to discover a particle basis for anomalous semantic interference.

When all non-anomalous material was discarded, what remained was five new anomalous particles in a family we have termed 'linguanons'.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Extensive experimentation has identified them as:

Phonemeons, which affect the irreducible building blocks of meaning, the quantum of language;

Morphemeons, which alter words;

Syntaxions, which strengthen, weaken or detach the 'glue' binding words into meaningful concepts;

Semantions, which inflect the meaning of words to suit context;

Orthons, which connect symbols to concepts.

It is our belief that PoI-382 and his historical colleagues produced these particles thaumaturgically; it is our further belief that, given sufficient time and resources, the process can be replicated.

The decomposition of anomalous sentences produces syntaxions and semantions as a byproduct. Sentences emit semantions when interacting with other sentences. The decomposition of anomalous individual words produces phonemeons, the base linguanon unit. Words are bound into sentences through strategic bombardment by orthons. The method of producing orthons is unclear; we are, therefore, limited to the use of whatever orthons can be salvaged from existing examples of PoI-382's work. Developing rigorous techniques for applying these processes will allow us to replicate, though initially in a crude manner, his cryptomantic effects.

The emblem PoI-382 created for "Scout's Cargo Packing," which generates an impenetrable aura of secrecy around it, is an excellent case subject for describing the effects of each particle. We separated all varieties of linguanon save one from an instance of the sign, and observed its effects on observers. With only the phonemeons present, the sign gave observers an inexplicable sense of "something [being] off." The morphemeons caused observers to forget the meanings of the words "Scout's," "Cargo," and "Packing." The syntaxions made the sign immensely fascinating. The semantions caused observers to associate the words "Scout's," "Cargo," and "Packaging" with concepts related to secrecy or stealth.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The orthons, most startlingly, revealed the existence of the SCP Foundation to observers! Each particle introduced a new nuance into the existing symbology of the English language words imprinted on the sign, working in concert to produce the effacing effect.

Proposal: Based on these findings, we assert the need for a comprehensive schedule of research into what we are calling QUANTUM LINGUAPHYSICS. The end goal of this schedule is the achievement of what we are calling PRAGMATICS, complete mastery over the field of cryptomancy — including the artificial production of each particle, orthons in particular. To demonstrate the attainment of that goal, we commit to the eventual production of an overarching thaumaturgic shield for all SCP Foundation activities, tentatively named THE FRONTISPIECE. Working in concert with linguanon-saturated imagery, this measure should permanently defuse the present geopolitical crisis.

Executive Summary: Quantum linguaphysics will allow the SCP Foundation to redefine the relationship between actual and perceptual reality.

The Site Directors' Executive Council of the Whole strenuously objected to this project on the basis of its potential to injure the combined cognition of mankind. The research group acknowledged this point in private correspondence with Site-01. The O5 Council's response was to suspend all meetings of the Executive Council until the conclusion of the Panopticon Crisis, at which point they would be free to again air their concerns.

Crocker’s campaign against the Foundation continued. In early February, whilst the Foundation was attempting to negotiate a new treaty with the People’s Republic of China, she used cryptomancy to instil a sense of severe paranoia in Chairman Mao Zedong (who had made the unusual decision to attend the talks in person). Mao specifically believed that the proxy for O5-10, Dr. Amity Noble, was wearing recording equipment broadcasting to western intelligence-gathering bases.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The talks rapidly deteriorated until Mao ordered the People's Liberation Army to forcibly eject the Foundation representatives. While Dr. Noble was able to escape unharmed, this event left the Foundation without any foothold in China until after the end of the Cold War.

Dr. Noble discovered a note in her personal effects upon arriving safely at Site-01:

Five minutes to midnight.

Crocker went on to infiltrate Site-95 for a period of two months. She alerted President Nixon to its existence, and Nixon ordered the US Army to storm and occupy the facility for the sake of national security. It is believed that USGOV intended to use Site-95 to falsify photographic evidence in the event that the Apollo program proved fruitless. Ultimately, Apollos 9-12, 14-17, and 19 were all successful in their missions to the moon, with Apollo 13 famously suffering a mechanical error and Apollo 18 [REDACTED], rendering the occupation moot. Site-95 would only be ceded back to the Foundation in November of 2001.

As the urgency of the Frontispiece project mounted, Drs. Euler, Okorie and Reynders began confronting the reality of what they were about to do. It became apparent that only direct contact with, and alteration of, the collective human consciousness would be able to effect the changes required to make the Frontispiece operative. Having intensively studied the budding field of noetics via the works of chemist Vladimir Vernadsky and philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Dr. Okorie declared the experiment technically possible. Troubled by the moral implications and desiring to commit their reasoning to posterity, however, each doctor typed a single note to be opened only when the full history of this event might finally be written.

The brutality of Crocker's methods continued to increase. She began killing Foundation personnel indiscriminately, using cryptomantic runes to induce targeted cardiac arrests or aneurysms; the runes would then dissipate before causing collateral damage. In May of 1969, Crocker used one of the first known instances of an auditory cryptomantic agent (embedded in a recording of The Beatles' "I Wanna Hold Your Hand") to kill ten members of Foundation personnel meeting in a safe house in Edinburgh, Scotland.

While ignorant of the Foundation's reverse-engineering of the Frontispiece, Zwist had supplied a series of single-use counteragents to Crocker’s cryptomantic assaults. These typically took the form of text and/or imagery which appeared at first glance to be non-anomalous and could easily be concealed until needed. These were now pressed into service, and demand very quickly outpaced supply.

The research group was now producing linguanons in vast quantities, including a very small supply of orthons.

Drs. Okorie and Euler hold up their own cards, printed with the letters "Y" and "Z" respectively.

Dr. Euler: We will be conducting an experiment in chained remote reading today; if it works, we will be implementing Project FRONTISPIECE in its entirety. The first thaumatologist will focus on their letter; beyond keeping their mental safeguards down, that will be their only role today. The next thaumatologist will focus on their letter, but also remote read the first. The third thaumatologist will focus on their letter, and remote read the second — and, by extension, the first as well.

Dr. Okorie: As we move down the line, each thaumatologist will be receiving more and more mental signals, containing the thought patterns of more and more of their fellow readers via mental daisy chain. Through this nuanced network of noetic signals they will begin to glimpse the contours of the sphere of reason, our shared conceptual network.

Every thaumatologist involved in this project has been fortified with mnestics and mind-focusing agents, to help mitigate the severe psychological strain we expect to experience. We have furthermore re-routed nearly the entire electrical system of this Site into a concentrated oriykalkos-core reactor; we need access to that much raw thaumic energy to make such an unprecedented intervention even remotely possible.

Dr. Reynders: Two points must be emphasized. First: this experiment is only feasible because of a lucky accident, a mistake made by the cryptomancer from whom we have co-opted these powers. I do not believe it will be possible for us to replicate this effect for the other letters of the alphabet, or to attempt any other alterations on this scale. I furthermore do not believe there will ever be sufficiently convincing reason to try, as the risk of permanently damaging worldwide human cognition is far too high.

Though both Drs. Euler and Okorie were severely drained by the process, the Frontispiece was successfully applied. Within two weeks its obfuscatory effects could be observed worldwide, as fronts which had formerly offered only limited protection now thoroughly frustrated enemy agents and offered obvious succour to Foundation operatives. It was found that continuing to apply linguanons to each sign produced an amplified effect; the practice therefore continued, as did research into more sophisticated applications.

The creation of new front organizations took place at a feverish pace. The Foundation re-established its revenue streams, and was able to fully resume normal functions in the western world by June of 1970. By 1971, revenue had reached the point where ten new high-cost containment Sites could be built each year. Governmental relations were essentially 'reset' during this period; each outgoing administration carried their anomie towards the Foundation with them, and the Frontispiece prevented the new arrivals from acquiring the leverage their predecessors had enjoyed. The Panopticon Crisis was essentially over.

Elizabeth Crocker eventually resurfaced in Canada, having founded a think-tank known as the Righting History Institute under the assumed identity of conservative political scientist Ophelia Righting. The Righting Institute had been working with a giftschreiber front in order to disrupt the 1979 Canadian federal election.

Three weeks later it was discovered that he had used thaumaturgy to capture audio of the events leading up to his death and imprint them on an EP vinyl record originally containing the Marvin Gaye album What's Going On.

Crocker herself remained active throughout the 1980s, passing on her knowledge of cryptomancy in the USA and Canada, in particular falling in with members of the 'phone phreaking' community; she may have been involved in the 1980 ARPANET Crash, as signs of cryptomancy proliferated through it, then the CSNET, and finally the internet.

As she had predicted, President Reagan proved less susceptible to SCP-001 than Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter, to the point where he promised to expose the Foundation in February of 1981. The attempt on his life on March 30th provided the Foundation an opportunity to expose him to memetic reinforcements while he received treatment at George Washington University Hospital. How Crocker knew of Reagan's Alzheimer's Disease over a decade before his official diagnosis remains unknown.

It is believed that Crocker is deceased as of 2021, barring access to anomalous life extension means; she would now be over one hundred years old. Fragmentary evidence suggests that an individual fitting her rough description was involved in the re-election of President George W. Bush in 2004, however, and the name "Ophelia Righting" appears on a roster of campaign staff. "Lisbet Geschenk," another likely alias, is on a list of financial donors.

For nearly four decades Dr. Euler refused, on practical grounds, to consider further alterations to the noosphere. The O5 Council also approached Dr. Reynders, who claimed to have exhausted her insights into the field of memetics. Dr. Euler declared the research group defunct, and was transferred to Site-87 in 1984. He and Dr. Ryan Melbourne collaborated on several more immediately practical projects, including the Memetic Resistance Index, Cognitive Resistance Value Index, and the Euler-Melbourne Memetic Resistance Test — all designed to combat the effects of cryptomantic proliferation.

You want me to make you a Zwist Army Knife, a tool for every occasion, and that's fine. In fact, it's far better than fine. I agree with it! But if you want me to help you bring an end to occasions, set the human race to a rigid schedule, take the uncertainty out of life beyond what's needed to keep life worth living… no. I agree with the giftschreiber on one thing, and one thing only: the value of free will. I was free to make my choice, and so was Dr. Okorie, and I believe I remain so free today.

You, of course, are freer still. I have advised you fairly and honestly in the past, so when I tell you what we should be doing with our freedom, please at least consider it: we should be protecting the people of this Earth, as we have claimed to already be doing, even to the point of protecting them from ourselves. We should not exert our will simply for the sake of doing so.

Should I seem to be moralizing from the moral low ground, please understand: that's where I got my perspective. I have helped you to remove one small, situational freedom from the world, and it's helped me to see the value of what remains. If we're going steal people's memories, dismantle their livelihoods, and alter their very perception — and thanks to the arms race we ourselves set in motion, we absolutely must do these things — we need to do it directly. Not through proxies, not through connivance, not in the mode of the giftschreiber. If we must be inhuman, we need to experience it at a human scale. Nothing less can keep us honest.

When we meddle with their matter from a distance, safely insulated from the reality of what we do, we are not scientists. We are not saviours. We are idealogues without the courage of our own convictions.

I doubt I could make you another Frontispiece without Ilse and Izzy anyway, and I know for a fact there's not another man or woman alive who could match us at what we did together.""")

Well, that's not entirely true. There is one.

No doubt he's watching.

Dr. Euler's injunction was granted. Though the work he carried out before and since represents the foundation of modern memetics, all experiments conducted subsequent to the Frontispiece — including the BERRYMAN-LANGFORD Project, and the Lillihammer Cognitohazard Register — continue to operate on individual cognition. Periodic votes are, however, held by the O5 Council to overturn Dr. Euler's objections to wide-range noetic tampering. As of this writing, the objections stand by a narrow margin; a slim majority of the Council believes that the inadvertent and inconvenient spread of memetics knowledge is directly attributable to the Frontispiece project, as Crocker suggested in 1980, and that repeating this experience could prove unwise.

Five decades of continuous experimentation has improved the individual memetic effects of all new memetic signage, before taking into account the blanket coverage of the Frontispiece effect; though older instances are therefore less efficient, subjecting them to acroamatic recycling is now a low priority due to the relative ease of modern linguanon production.

All SCP-001 media still retain the singular flaw allowing individuals familiar with the anomalous to see through their effects. While occasionally useful in the event the Foundation must coordinate with organizations such as OSAT, the Global Occult Coalition, the FBI's Unusual Incidents Unit, the British Occult Service or Poland's ZM "Witch Slayer" Division, this is more often than not a detriment to efficient clandestine operations. Many theories have been advanced to explain this curious defect, and the discovery of a note from Thilo Zwist in Dr. Euler's effects after his death in 2013 has provided fertile ground for further speculation. It has been dated to 1980, the year of Dr. Okorie's murder.

To a certain extent. I myself have acted more rashly on such sympathetic impulses (though not for a few centuries).

You alone now carry the responsibility. You must ensure that what you did can never again be done, ensure that it was worth doing in the first place, and most of all ensure that you — only you — can do it again, should the worst come to pass. You must also remember how seductive a quick and dirty solution can be, and show your successors where the pitfalls lie. It is not enough that your apprentices succeed you; they must also excel you.

The Foundation protects the world. You sometimes like to imagine you do it alone, reciting comfortable, meaningless aphorisms to cover a great deal of violence, cupidity, ruthlessness and cruelty. You will forgive me if I hope you do not find your burdens light.

Is the Frontispiece that perfect creation you imagined it would be, as your equations and diagrams assure you it must in fact be, or does the wind keep rushing beneath it, exposing you to the surrounding climate?

CLASSIFIED
Item #: SCP-001
Pending

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: Full containment procedures have not been finalized due to recent changes in the status of SCP-001, detailed at the conclusion of this file with a tentative response plan. Foundation policy on cybernetic implants is currently frozen, pending Council vote.

DESCRIPTION: SCP-001 is an extradimensional 'bubble' of self-contained reality, located in the southern Arabian desert, inaccessible to individuals that do not have prior knowledge of SCP-001's location. Traveling through the desert with only the intention of reaching SCP-001 is not sufficient; express and exact knowledge of its geographical position is required.

Notably, individuals with some sort of artificial implant — ranging from surgical screws and plates to complex prosthetics — appear to have a higher chance of success in locating and entering the anomaly. The purpose and range of this is unclear, but personnel with implants successfully entered SCP-001 in 88% of tests, compared to standard personnel's 62%.

SCP-001 contains an ancient metropolis partially buried in the sand. Maps and initial sonar testing indicate approximately two thirds of this city are aboveground and largely intact, while the subterranean portion has degraded heavily and is no longer structurally sound. The aboveground portion is made up of skyscrapers and buildings up to half a kilometer high using modern design techniques far beyond those available at the time of construction, which has been carbon dated to approximately 2,400 BCE. The buildings are fully set and furnished, and appear to have served residential, commercial, bureaucratic, and various other uses. The largest and most intricate of these buildings is a large temple structure in the center of the city that extends through all thirds.

There are no living organisms inside the city (See Section 001.4).""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

The buildings also contain artistic works and large bas-reliefs depicting a variety of scenes ranging from apparently-religious stories to historical events. These contain writing in an unknown language containing elements of Old Arabic (See Section 001.2). Most of these are concentrated in the temple at the heart of SCP-001.

The subterranean floors are dominated by extensive, complex machinery. These range from antiquated clockwork systems to vacuum tubes to power generators extremely similar to modern nuclear reactors. However, all machinery is nonfunctional and appears to be in a state of advanced disrepair.

SCP-001-A is a collective designation for all automata found within the city, chief among which is SCP-001-A1 (See Section 001.2).

SCP-001-A1 has identified the city as being the origin for the Quranic myth of Iram of the Pillars (See Section 001.1), but has clarified that its proper name is Amoni-Ram.

Section 001.1
HISTORICAL BRIEFING
The first mention of Iram in mundane literature is in the eighty-ninth chapter of the Quran, lines six through fourteen. They reference ”Iram – who had lofty pillars, the likes of whom had never been created in the lands” as a culture subject to divine retribution by God for their oppression of others.

6: Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with ‘Aad –
7: [With] Iram – who had lofty pillars,
8: The likes of whom had never been created in the lands
9: And [with] Thamud, who carved out the rocks in the valley?
10: And [with] Pharaoh, owner of the Pyramids? –
11: [All of] whom oppressed within the lands
12: And increased therein the corruption.
13: So your Lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment.
14: Indeed, your Lord is in observation.

One journal partially dictated an encounter with a vast, ruined city accessible only to those who knew its location, but moisture damage had left it largely unreadable. An interview was conducted

INTERVIEWER: Doctor Hedvig Nussbaum, Parahistory Division, Special Consultant on Anomalous Cults and Cultures

SUBJECT: SCP-1867 ("Lord Theodore Thomas Blackwood")

«BEGIN LOG»

SCP-1867: Evening, madam!

NUSSBAUM: Hello, Lord Blackwood.

SCP-1867: I must say, it's heartening to see someone of the gentler sex in such an academic position. Warms the cockles of my heart.

NUSSBAUM: … Right. Well, we would like to talk to you about one of the items recovered from your vault. A journal titled "Lord Blackwood in the First Cities of Man".

SCP-1867: Of course, of course. Penned from 1800 to 1824. Does the journal not answer your questions? I recall being very thorough.

NUSSBAUM: Water damage has left it unreadable.

SCP-1867: I see, that's a shame. Well! It's been quite a while, but I remember that adventure fondly. Initiated by a gift given to my by one Monsieur Jacques Brazeau of le estate Noir. Agents of the French crown had recovered it before the revolution from an ancient shipwreck in Aegean Sea.

NUSSBAUM: What was it?

SCP-1867: A set of six clay tablets, remarkably preserved for their age. Detailing the existence of three empires spanning Asia, thousands of years old and more powerful and advanced than any culture since, even our own. And, of course, their nigh-apocalyptic war.

NUSSBAUM: You would think something like that would leave evidence.

SCP-1867: Yes, I was similarly skeptical upon my first reading of the tablets.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" But they addressed those inquiries - these empires were advanced occultists, magicians and magic-users, ruled by sorcerer-nawabs. Hiding their cities from their enemies was a trivial task, and exactly why the mundane scholars have found nothing.

NUSSBAUM: But not you, I take it?

SCP-1867: Exactly correct, madam. I believe I have a copy of one of the pages from the journal stashed away somewhere, I'll see if we can't find that. But in simplest terms, the first of the three great cities of Man was Amoni-Ram, located in the sands of Arabia. As luck would have it, Monsieur Brazeau was accompanying General Bonaparte - still a general at the time, thank heavens - on his campaign into Egypt. Simple matter for me and a small expedition to tag along and then diverge into the peninsula.

NUSSBAUM: So you knew the location of the city at this point?

SCP-1867: In a fashion. You see, the tablets claim Amoni-Ram was hidden after the other empires allied to attack it, as it was a superior center of knowledge and weaponry. Only those who knew its location could enter. And its location happened to be recorded in the tablets. Three days into the desert, we found it. It was like passing into a bubble, and the towers became visible over the horizon.

NUSSBAUM: Towers, you said?

SCP-1867: Great buildings fashioned of metal, impossibly tall - easily hundreds of meters. A bronze glow set them alight from the sun overhead. There must have been a dozen of these sky-scraping buildings, between them resting smaller but still grand buildings of marble, stone, clay. Towering minarets and domes like those found in Mohammedan temples. A grand sight, altogether. The city must have been able to hold hundreds of thousands of people - we explored a tiny fraction of the surface portion.

NUSSBAUM: There was a subterranean area?

SCP-1867: Even bigger than the surface, I would say.""")

Machinery I could not begin to guess the purpose of, all still as death.

NUSSBAUM: Did you find any entities inside the city?

SCP-1867: No living ones, though my men repeatedly claimed they heard something skittering about while we stayed in the city. I dismissed it as wildlife, sandrabbits or such. We never saw anything.

NUSSBAUM: What about dead ones?

SCP-1867: Yes. Entire sections of the tunnels were impassable - growths of a strange black vine, as thick as a man, winding and knotting entire passageways. It appeared petrified. There were also curious bulbous sacs sticking to the walls and ceiling of many buildings, under and above ground. I prodded these with my sword - they leaked, spewing out a decomposing specimen that smelled like death. An impossibly emaciated man, skin burnt away by the acid. We did not touch them again.

NUSSBAUM: Sounds like something bad happened there.

SCP-1867: Indeed. Throughout, the city has a very specific…. air, I suppose.

NUSSBAUM: An air?

SCP-1867: The distinct feeling of walking into a graveyard.

ATTACHED DOCUMENT — JULY 1983


In the beginning, there were three.
A thousand years before, before man learned of Olympus, before the extinction of the giants, before the sea had full regressed, there were three. Three great cities dividing the world tripartite.

Mamjul and Korar, two dark fortresses resting in the jungles of the subcontinent.""")

Adytum, a city thrown into rebellion by a charismatic slave turned lay preacher who promised wealth, freedom, and power to those that would help him. Together they threw off their yokes, slaughtered their oppressors with their new sorcery and rebuilt their collapsed city, all under the name of the Grand Karcist Ion. The Nälka Empire freed the second magic - carnomancy, the magic of flesh.

Amoni-Ram, first great Ram of the Mekhanite Empire as it spread like a wildfire from the deserts. A gleaming, shining metropolis rising out of the dunes - a center of knowledge, science, understanding that the world had never seen. The magic of machines became known, the fervor for a new god that sought to uplift men, not subjugate them.

A thousand years before, the three great nations of men fought a war that destroyed the world.

The Aegean Tablets go on to clarify that Amoni-Ram was ruled by a theocratic cult in the area. The endonym of the group is unknown, but the Greek tablets refer to it exclusively as the Mekhanite Cult or Cult of the Broken God. No other evidence for this group had been discovered thus far.

Distinguished himself with superior, prodigal knowledge and skill in handling paratechnology; promoted to Senior Researcher in 1982.

Other Notes: Left arm and leg amputated below the elbow and knee following laboratory accident at Prometheus. Replaced with high-quality anomalous prosthetics that allow fine motor movement and limited tactile sensation. Due to his dependence on them to function in the workplace, they have not been placed into containment and are in his full-time custody.

Researchers were organized primarily into two groups - an engineering team headed by Doctor Aram to investigate the technology of Amoni-Ram and SCP-001-A instances, and an anthropological team headed by Doctor Nussbaum to investigate the history, culture, and ultimate fate of the 'Mekhanite Empire'.

A general directive was given for all researchers and Tactical Response Officers to avoid the subterranean undercity until a detachment from MTF Zeta-9 ("Mole Rats")1 could arrive to map it out and declare it safe for study. In the meantime, both groups began investigating the rest of the surface city and compiling preliminary reports.

AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE

Preliminary notes on the paratechnology of Amoni-Ram

I've encountered many strange, unique things over my career at Prometheus and the Foundation, but I can firmly state that I've never seen anything quite as magical as Amoni-Ram.""")

So far we've only been able to investigate the machinery on the surface city (I'm told the real treasure is under the streets, but obviously we can't explore that right now) which appears to be largely concentrated in the upper floors of the skyscrapers, though I think calling them skyscrapers is an understatement. Each is about 500m, a little taller than Sears Tower. A marvel of engineering in and of itself, but not an obviously anomalous one. What they contain, however, is a different story.

For my layman's perspective, they appear to be combination residential, office, and bureaucratic buildings. Each floor seems to consign itself to one of those three types, and contains appropriate pieces of technology - most are too degraded to be useful, but the fact that they're there at all after thousands of years is incredible. I can discern the purposes of about a quarter of them, though. They're all anomalous to some extent - the drones are writing up detailed reports now, but they variously break laws of thermodynamics, physics, and matter conservation, and often simply use magic to do things as mundane as copy documents or keep food hot or cold.

And, of course, the automata. Little machines, made of a golden metal and built to resemble animals that this culture in the middle of the desert could have no possible way of knowing about. Definitely sentient, possibly sapient - fully mechanical (I found a broken-open one on the street and took it as a sample, picture attached) but demonstrating what looks to me like primitive artificial intelligence. There must be hundreds of them, at least - my guess is that they were designed to maintain the city and, for the millenia it's lain abandoned, they've been doing exactly that. They're pretty cute, to be honest.

Whatever this civilization was, the anomalous was so pedestrian to them they were using paratechnology we even now barely understand as household appliances and servants.""")

FROM THE DESK OF DOCTOR HEDVIG NUSSBAUM
AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE
Personal thoughts on the historical potential of Amoni-Ram

I have to continually pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming. A vast city, undocumented by anyone else in the modern era, hiding a culture that had blended advanced magic and technology to settle half of Asia while the Egyptians had yet to settle the Nile. If the evidence wasn't surrounding me, I'd call myself a liar.

We've already discovered much. Some of the researchers are more interested in investigating the individual houses and homes to see what an average citizen lived like - completely understandable. That said, I'm far more intrigued by this 'Cult of Mekhane' that seems to pervade every aspect of Amoni-Ram.

In the ruins of Sumer and other ancient cities, religious iconography is common. Here, it's ubiquitous; the palace-temple is the most obvious example of this, with mechanical bas-reliefs that seem to tell a creation myth laid throughout. The buildings, houses, shops, skyscrapers, even the machinery Robert's team is disassembling have this religious significance about them.

It's especially fascinating since practically nothing else is known to us about the religion or culture of these 'Mekhanites' beyond the admittedly-questionable statements of Lord Blackwood. Even the name Mekhanite is a Greek epithet used in the Aegean tablets, derivative of mekhane; machine. As it stands, their culture is a blackbox, and even with the murals and writings, I doubt we will ever have more than a passing understanding of this once-great civilization - and what happened to them.

ECHO-4: Might not be an industrial area at all.

ECHO-1: Alright, we appear to have reached the bottom. Instruments say we are 25m below ground.

ECHO-3: We're in some sort of corridor. Walls are stone but there's those same pipes in every direction. There's a couple of paths we could take.

ECHO-1: Taking the first left, left-hand rule. Leave a marker trail.

ECHO-4: Huh.

ECHO-3: Well, don't go- Fuck!

ECHO-1: Mm. Well, we're not getting through here. Let's go back, take the other way.

ECHO-1: A plant that kills. Stay sharp.

ECHO-4: And here's one of those pods.

ECHO-4: Yep. Corpse. Highly decomposed, just like Blackwood found.

[ECHO team continues through the tunnels, encountering a large amount of the vines with their victims. They also encounter mass graves similar to those found by MAGELLAN on the surface.]

ECHO-2: These walls are all covering machinery, I just realized. I can see parts through the cracks in the metal.

MURAL ANALYSIS
AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE

The temple courtyard contains intricate murals depicting what Dr. Nussbaum theorizes is a creation myth for the extant Mekhanite culture. Accompanying these are plaques bearing an inscription in Mekhanite. While the rest of the archaelogical team investigated the rest of the city, a small team was dedicated to translating the courtyard engravings.

Side Description: First relief depicts a scene of three figures wrestling in a dark void, followed by the figures falling to different corners of a slightly inaccurate2 map of Asia. One lands in the far corner of the Indian subcontinent, one lands on the coast of China, and one lands in the center of the Arabian peninsula. This final figure dominates the rest of the scenes; it is revealed to be a massive but lithe figure dressed in golden armor. A shepherd, his wife, and his three lame sheep happen upon it buried in the sand, obviously wounded.

Translation of Plaque: BEFORE THE NEW PANTHEON, BEFORE THE SMOKE AND THE SINGING, THE OLD GODS FOUGHT THEIR WAR OVER NOTHING. THEY WOUNDED EACH OTHER AND FELL, TWISTING AND WRITHING, TO THE LOWEST WORLD. MEKHANE, BLESSED BE HER NAME, ALIGHTED IN THE FAR WEST UNDER THE SCORCHING GAZE OF THE SUN. SHE RESTED IN THE DUNES, UNCOVERED BY THE FLOCK OF A SHEPHERD - BUMARO.

Side Description: The god reaches out and touches the shepherd and his wife.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The shepherd's missing leg is replaced by a metal limb, and his shepherd's crook is replaced by a spear, both made from the golden metal. His wife's eyes glow gold, and large metal wings spring from her back. The sheep are armored over to resemble SCP-001-A instances. Together, the shepherd, his wife, and their flock attempt to raise the god from the sand.

Translation of Plaque: MEKHANE DREW FORTH HER TOUCH AND RAISED THEM. BUMARO'S LAME LEG REPLACED BY A GREAVE, HEDARA'S SIGHT RESTORED AND ALL GIVEN THE FORM OF THE ANGELS. GRATEFUL, THEY SOUGHT TO RAISE THEIR NEW GOD FROM HER TOMB, AND THEY FAILED.

Side Description: The god digs deeper, lying facedown in the sand. It looks up at the shepherd and strips the armor from its massive fist. The shepherd takes the armor and fashions a simple forge, melting and reforging it into a suit of armor in the image of the god and a massive throne. He returns to his village, where the people naturally submit to him. Many are disabled and lacking limbs. They return to the resting place of the god, who touches them all in turn, replacing their shortcomings with its gifts. They rejoice and, as the god strips its armor, use the metal to construct a shining city on its back.

Translation of Plaque: SHE KNEW THAT THE WOUND WAS NOT MORTAL, BUT CRIPPLING. SHE UNDERSTOOD HER FATE - AND ENTRUSTED HER LEGACY TO BUMARO AND HIS BLOOD. HE BECAME THE FIRST BLACKSMITH, SHAPING THE METAL OF HER BODY AS SHE SHAPED LIFE ITSELF. HE MADE HIMSELF IN HER IMAGE, AND THE PEOPLE WERE AWED. FOR THEIR FAITH, THEY WERE UPLIFTED BEYOND THE CHAINS OF HUMANITY, AND FROM HER STRIPPED ARMOR THEY RAISED THE FIRST CITY ON THE BACK OF THE SLEEPING GODDESS - AMONI-RAM, CITY OF FULADH, SHINING GATE OF THE WEST.

From September to February, hundreds of pieces of technology were analyzed and investigated by the engineering team.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" While many were too degraded to be of any practical use, they were still highly illuminating in determining the technology level of the extant Mekhanite culture. A few particularly notable discoveries are attached:

Description: Four-meter poles inset into the ground at various intervals through the streets of Amoni-Ram. Six disc-shaped objects, a meter wide, top each pole. When an electrical current is applied to the pole, the discs begin to knock against each other, emitting radio waves of unclear purpose. Currently theorized to be some sort of conductor system for the city, possibly an attempt at creating a free, wireless power system.

Description: Large, partially subterranean greenhouses occupying a significant portion of the western district of the city. Copper pipes running underground gases alternatingly cool and heat them according to valves, and the greenhouses are several floors tall, utilizing novel organization and irrigation techniques. Operating at maximum efficiency, a large portion of the city's theorized half-a-million population could have been fed by them.

Description: A series of magnetically charged rails running through the city in a loop, though all the cars have been completely ruined. Applying a specific electrical charge allows rapid, high-speed movement through the city - based on the lack of stations or stopping points, this is believed to have been a "hop-on, hop-off" method of mass transit at extraordinarily low overhead.

Description: Small metal shields with two switches on the handle. When fully powered, one switch projects a rapidly-oscillating energy shield that protects the wearer against fast-moving kinetic objects. The shield can be maintained for up to twenty minutes on a full charge. The other switch projects a skintight shield that camouflages the wearer with their surroundings, effectively rendering them invisible.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" This is much more power-intensive and can only be maintained for three to six minutes depending on movement.

Description: Large constructs, two in every district, set into the ground, though not part of the undercity. The locks and seals have been damaged. Inside are large machines that have been investigated to contain radioactive material. Details are currently sealed, but the engineering team is of the opinion that these could have been functional nuclear or possibly cold-fusion reactors, supplying electricity to the city's power grid and 'power poles'.

Description: Unclear. Large sections of the undercity are inaccessible, making thorough analysis difficult - however, the engineering team is agreed in that a significant portion of the undercity appears to be one gargantuan machine incorporating mundane technology along with paratechnology. Further research required.

In the process of research and excavation, SCP-001-A instances led the archaeological team to a structure within the Southern district that appeared to be a record center, possibly a library or university. While the vast majority of the paper documents contained therein were rotted and illegible, the metal and clay tablets were remarkably well-preserved. The instances further directed personnel to a basement section containing a large metal safe, since rusted off its hinges. Within was a cache of several dozen metal cylinders measuring 10cm in diameter, imprinted with writing in Mekhanite. Due to their form, the language, and several other factors, only one was immediately translated.

Due to the substantial amount of paratech and parahistorical findings submitted to Overwatch Command by the Amoni-Ram Initiative since active research began six months prior, O5-11 scheduled a meeting with the Initiative leads on March 2nd, approximately eight months after the initial discovery of the Mekhanite culture, using the Secure Leyspace Communicator.

OPERATOR: Ley connection to Overwatch Command established. Doctor Nussbaum, Doctor Aram, O5-11 is waiting. Please step into the Communicator.

[NUSSBAUM and ARAM step onto the raised metal platform.]

NUSSBAUM: Oh, mein gott.

[The Leyspace cycles through several locations before settling into a view of a small asphalt parking lot in what appears to be the American Southwest. Mesas and bluffs dot the horizon, and the sun is high in the blue sky. There are no buildings or structures in sight; there is a single black Maybach parked in the lot. An older man in a finely pressed grey suit stands in front of it, hands in his pockets.]

O5-11: Hello, guys. Welcome to my little kingdom.

NUSSBAUM: Where… are we?

ARAM: A Leyspace. A virtual projection with no data transfer delay, all powered by the ley lines of the Earth. And it costs a fortune to run. I should know, I helped design it.

O5-11: Well, it did. But with the recent improvements that have come out of your project, it now only costs a small fortune to run, so thanks for that. Just one taste of what we've been able to do so far with SCP-001's technology. So! Tell me everything.

ARAM: Everything, sir?

O5-11: Everything important. I've read the reports, but I want to hear it from the horse's mouth. Doctor Nussbaum? Your progress so far?

NUSSBAUM: Yes.""")

They had a complex legal and justice system, a novel family structure incorporating distant cousins into large households and 'clans'-

O5-11: Yes, anthropology, fascinating. I was wondering if you had figured out any more of their later history?

NUSSBAUM: "Later history", sir?

O5-11: What happened to them. Between the technological and the archaelogical reports, this was a culture that was undisputed as the most advanced in the world at the time, but they also keep mentioning this war with the other two nations, the- this "Adytum" of the Nälka Empire and the Mamjul referenced as the capital of the Daevite Covenant. What that signals to me - and do tell me if I'm wrong, please - is that these two empires were each powerful enough to withstand a war with the Mekhanite culture. And, depending on what happened to Amoni-Ram, bring it to its knees.

NUSSBAUM: I suppose so, sir, but the Aegean tablets do not give a precise location for the other two cities, and if we do want to find them - well, a location could be anywhere, in a shipping record, in a letter to a distant cousin-

O5-11: That's fine, but we need to figure out how this city died. And I'd be pretty goddamn willing to bet that the… things you found in the undercity are related. The flesh-thingies and the plants.

NUSSBAUM: Nothing has been confirmed yet. Though it does seem quite likely.

O5-11: Hmph. Well, in the meantime, see what you can get out of that robot down there…. what's its name?

O5-11: Well- okay, slow your roll. We don't know what happened to them, like I said. For all we know, their technology led them to their downfall, so let's wait before getting any ideas of dragging the world into the 21st century early. Let's focus on changing the Foundation first, right Robert?

ARAM: Yes, sir.

O5-11: Good. But I suppose that if you want to improve the rate of research, you're going to need more people.

ARAM: Yes. I have a list of requisition requests. All sorts of machinery, excavation equipment, HAZMAT equipment and scientific machinery. Funding, of course.

O5-11: Naturally. Forward it to my Factotum, we'll take care of anything you need. We're very excited about this over at Site-01, you know. Very excited to see what comes out of Amoni-Ram next.

ARAM: We also need… people.

O5-11: How many people?

ARAM: Right now there's about 50 of us, and the security. But we're stretched thin to explore a whole city - I've run the numbers and 200 additional personnel would give us the arms we need.

O5-11: That's a lot of arms, Robert. Not something I can make happen with a snap of my fingers.

ARAM: I have a list of names I can forward. And it is a lot, but we've barely scratched the surface of what the Mekhanites left us, and already are reaping the rewards. Surely it's worth it?

O5-11: Can't disagree there. You'll have your people within two months. Might need to consider expanding.

ARAM: I'm inclined to agree. Which is why I wanted to request your permission to see if we can't get certain aspects of the city working again.

Section 001.5
LATER RESEARCH
The additional personnel and requisitions arrived via airlift to ARF-01 throughout March and April of 1984. The sudden threefold increase in personnel required immediate expansion - ARF-02 was established in another structurally-intact skyscraper in the Southern district of Amoni-Ram, each site now holding approximately one hundred personnel.

To connect the two sites, the disused rail system of Amoni-Ram was brought back into functional condition to ferry materials and personnel. This further necessitated the repair and refurbishment of the city's power grid and reactors, using technical assistance from SCP-001-A1 and its automatons. While the cold fusion reactors required extensive study and repair, the relatively simpler nuclear reactors incorporating paratechnology were slowly brought online using requisitioned nuclear fuel. On April 12th, the first two thaumic reactors came online, providing power to the entire Western and Southern districts of the city, allowing use of lighting, air conditioning, and of the rail system to ferry personnel and materials between the two sites.

ATTACHED DOCUMENT - APRIL 1984


And the sweep of the Golden Legion took three long centuries of expansion as the Mekhanite Empire's legates established beautiful, harmonious dominion on the oases and villages of the world. And as they expanded, they found relics - artifacts sheared from MEKHANE during their god's fall from heaven, scattered over the Earth, and with each relic carried back to Amoni-Ram the fervor of the people grew and grew as their leaders rose, warred, and died for their heirs.
And as the Legion marched forward over those long centuries, two other nations of man marched. The Covenant of the Daeva rode forth on their great horrible spirit-beasts, searing a path through the jungle from their twin-city of Mamjul Korar. And they used their black magic to open a gap, stepping from one side of the continent to another, and those that went through established another city - Adytum, that would after another two centuries fall to its own slaves, branding themselves the Nälka.

And all these parties marched into Asia, only vaguely aware of the existences of the other two until the Battle of Harumar, where they collided. The existence was an affront - the disgusting flesh-beasts of the Nälka an insult to the steel glory of MEKHANE, and the Covenant's plant-spirits choking and infesting the gears and wheels of the Legion, and so the Legion fired the first mortar, shattering the Covenant's ranks, and thus began a war that would end with the destruction of Asia.

The First War raged across the continent in every theater. Fleets of golden-hulled warships constructed in Amoni-Ram and pushed downriver to encounter the Covenant in the Bay. The Nälka raised an army of the dishonored dead from Adytum and marched them ceaselessly to throw themselves in the front line, choking the vines of the sorcerer-nawabs.""")

Forests were scorched during retreat to deny the Covenant seed, and the warriors of the Nälka and Covenant chose to throw their weapons in the sea rather than surrender the precious metal to the foundries of the Legion. And the COLOSSI, great thousand-arm-tall goliaths of steel and bronze and fuladh that rent the sky down upon the Nälkan hordes. Every second man was killed in the fighting, and it raged for three hundred years and would have gone on forever until the Abominate landed his ships on the western coast of Aethiopia and began his march to Amoni-Ram.

FROM THE DESK OF RESEARCHER MUHAMMAD ZAID
AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE

Memo to Doctor Robert Aram

I understand you're recovering from extended experimentation with the Throne - not to disturb your rest, but the team thinks we've come up with a solid theory on what the device under the city, the Mekhane's Kiss, is.

Just some background context - some of the geologists that came in during the second wave of personnel made some interesting but, at the time, irrelevant discoveries, amounting to the revelation that the sand within SCP-001 is of a slightly different chemical composition to the sand outside it. The sand inside is more similar to a kind of white sand found in a section of the Arabian desert several hundred miles the north-east.

We didn't know what to make of it, but the recent research into the undercity has changed things. We've mapped out the whole device - it occupies 65% of the undercity's volume, practically everything is connected to it that isn't stuff like the sewers. Its components have also become more understandable with our new experience on Mekhanite design architecture and philosophy. The technology is antiquated, but it's almost all paratech - extremely powerful conduits, convertors, connections, etc, all terminating in a small chamber emitting extremely high levels of radiation. We sent a protected probe in, warding it - it melted a few minutes later but we ran the pictures and energy signals against the database and got… nothing. We've never seen anything like it.

But then, Tenz decided to call in a few favors and run it against the GOC database. Apparently they have seen something like it, and tried to weaponize it - a long-distance, large-scale matter de/reconstructor and emitter. A gigantic teleporter, basically. Apparently big enough to move an entire city hundreds of kilometers. Mekhane's Kiss isn't a superweapon, it's a Hail Mary.

Unfortunately, it's completely burned out.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" It'd require a team months to get it back into remotely working order, and that's ignoring the problem of power. It's way too demanding to pull from the city's power grid - we think it draws directly from the cold fusion reactors, which is another impossibility. Plus we still don't know how it was controlled, or how any of the computation works without… well, computers. In any case, I don't think Amoni-Ram will be teleporting anywhere soon.

And in the sixtieth year of the war, as the fighting reached a crescendo and Thamud burned with the shelling of the Legion on the flesh-hordes of the Nälka, the Matriarch of the Covenant and the Grand Karcist Ion met under the shadow of night in the black catacombs of Adytum. And there they came to understand a truth - bitter enemies though they might be, the flesh of the Nälka and the plants of the Covenant were an extension of each other, both extrusions of the natural world. Evenly matched, neither could truly destroy the other. But the Mekhanite blessed steel was something else - a gift from the sky, well capable of crushing each of them. But together, they stood a chance.
And such it was that as the invasion plans were drawn and the great siege engines were constructed and the polearms cooled in the foundries, the Golden Legion marshalled and marched themselves, beginning the long, bloody truck to Adytum. And as they crossed through the desert of Asia, the Nälka were lending their forces to another invasion, this one raised by the sorcerer-nawabs with the Daeva against Amoni-Ram. A black, wicked army secretly gathering in the jungles of the South, marching on the suddenly-vulnerable First Ram of the Mekhanites. And with them came the magics - the Nälka offered one of their greatest boons, a plague to infest the city. And the Covenant offered the Song of the Daeva to make the verdant greenery of the desert rebel against its masters.""")

And even then, their marshaled forces were not enough to dominate the colossi and take the city. But in the Far West, beyond the Gate, another storm was brewing. The Abominate, may his name never be spoken of, stood on the shores of the coast as the Damned Fleet disembarked from their massive ships. And his army assembled itself from his prisoners and his soldiers, and the march to the East, to Amoni-Ram, began. The city settled between two unstoppable forces, neither aware of the other's presence, as the two armies pushed to the walls of the city and the head of its king, queen, and general.

Another meeting with O5-11 was scheduled for June 26th to ascertain the progress of the Amoni-Ram Initiative and relay new discoveries regarding the fate of the Mekhanite culture. On June 25th, an unidentified aircraft was detected 10km away from SCP-001. Upon confirmation that the aircraft was approaching SCP-001's entrance, ARF-01 radioed it asking for identification. The aircraft responded with valid Overwatch Command credentials, coming to a close landing and allowing O5-11 to disembark and enter SCP-001, escorted by MTF Alpha-1 "Red Right Hand".

NUSSBAUM: Yes, but we didn't expect you to, ah-

O5-11: Show up in person? Don't blame you, we're not exactly an outgoing bunch. But I've heard so many great things about this city over the past year. About its secrets, architecture, technology, culture, history. I wanted to see it for myself.""")

ARAM: Everything you were hoping for?

O5-11: That and more. I'll admit it does look a lot nicer now that you've started to rebuild the place.

ARAM: Thanks. We've managed to get primary power back online, along with the train system and a lot of the undercity's navigation maps and such. The power and climate control as well, obviously. We're going to try and get the city's weaponry back online soon, see what kind of defensive technology they were packing.

O5-11: Hold that thought. Doctor Nussbaum?

NUSSBAUM: Yes?

O5-11: I'm told your historical team has made several breakthroughs recently. Especially using the Throne-anomaly. Which, if I recall correct, you're the primary test subject for, Doctor Aram?

ARAM: That's correct. We've done about a dozen tests since we discovered it - only a handful have turned up anything substantial, it's mostly fragmented memories from old kings. Watching as the streets swell with citizens and goods flood into the markets. Visions of battlefields as the Mekhanite army takes on the Covenant and the Nälka.

O5-11: Right. And of course, you've translated…. how many of the recovered tablets now?

NUSSBAUM: Dozens, over a hundred. But like the Throne records, most are simple, banal correspondence.

O5-11: But not the recent ones.

NUSSBAUM: Correct. I have a presentation compiled in my office. Shall we?

O5-11: Lead the way.

O5-11: Hm. I expected more of a… cantonment. But no, you seem quite comfortably set up here.

[NUSSBAUM laughs.]

NUSSBAUM: Well, we have been here for nearly a year now. Plenty of time to settle in. And expanding to the second site has also helped free up space. Everyone has their own chambers.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

ARAM: Home sweet home.

NUSSBAUM: Anyway. As you know, we have made great strides recently in determining the fate of Amoni-Ram and the Mekhanite culture at large, using translated historical records in tandem with the Throne visions and SCP-001-A1's admittedly limited accounts. It has been established that the Daevic Covenant originate from the Indian subcontinent and the Nälka are likely from Central or East Asia. But the later records repeatedly mention a fourth party - the so-callled 'Abominate'. As of now, we know functionally nothing about who or what this is - only that they were in possession of a fleet of seafaring vessels that landed on the shores west of Amoni-Ram, in the 'Old Country'. My hypothesis is that this is West Africa.

O5-11: The records say this figure marched to Amoni-Ram.

NUSSBAUM: While the Covenant-Nälka coalition marched from the east, yes.

O5-11: An army crossing the entire breadth of the Sahara four-thousand years ago is… hard-to-believe.

ARAM: It's not the strangest thing we've seen out here.

NUSSBAUM: Indeed. We also have reason to believe that the Gobi desert was a significant theater in the First War, which would suggest the three primary cultures also had some sort of experience warring in deserts.

O5-11: You say three primary cultures - you don't include the Abominate in the equation?

NUSSBAUM: We are not sure if they're human yet, much less a distinct culture group. The Aegean tablets also do not mention any fourth party in the First war. However, I also have been in contact with some colleagues of mine at King Saud University, researching the mundane Thamud culture in the northwest. They recently unearthed a trove of tablets in the region, apparently detailing a cataclysmic battle between four armies for control of a major city.

O5-11: Bingo.

NUSSBAUM: Yes. I already have some people translating it - it is quite complex, but full translations should be ready within the month.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" In any case, the Mekhanite records we have found indicate that in the later stages of the war, the Nälka and Daevic Covenant allied themselves to take Amoni-Ram while the Mekhanite's Golden Legion marched across Asia to Adytum, the Nälka capital. This covers three of our armies, and evidently the Abominate is the fourth. But they also imply that the combined force of the Nälka and Daevic Covenant was not enough to take the city - that the Abominate, whatever it is, is more responsible for the fall of Amoni-Ram.

O5-11: Goddamn. That's… disconcerting. But I suppose that there's nothing to do now but wait for translations, yes?

NUSSBAUM: That would appear to be the case.

O5-11: Right. Doctor Aram, you said you had updates about the technology?

ARAM: That's right. We've discovered a lot of military weapons, it looks like - they range from CQC polearms and swords and what seem to be primitive chainsaws to long-range shoulder-mounted mortars and elephant guns. These were all in ruined warehouses in the sacked portion of the city, but we've also made a few interesting finds in the undercity.

O5-11: Do tell.

ARAM: First, a few suits of functional power armor, of the kind in the Throne records. Exoskeletons to enhance strength, speed, durability, power, some of them even flight-capable through gravity-defying paratechnology. Unfortunately, they were unusable without Mekhanite implants to link to.

O5-11: Well that's a goddamn shame.

ARAM: Was. A few days later, SCP-001-A directed us to another chamber in the undercity. This one filled with assembly lines, industrial sections - and crates on crates of Mekhanite implants. Fuladh and steel bionic arms, legs, prosthetics, torso cages, even heads. And of course sensory implants - replacement visuals and sensory suites, just like ours. The Foundation already gives those things out like candy - so I think they're worth experimenting on, with D-Class.""")

ARAM: Sure. Okay. In the meantime, we'd like to try and see if the city's defensive systems still work. The ones I saw in my visions. The mechs, the gun emplacements.

O5-11: These… visions. You trust them?

ARAM: I do. Seen them with my own two- well, not eyes, but you know what I mean. Why wouldn't I?

O5-11: Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but I don't lay my faith in all the technology quite so easily. I'd be wary. But, if what you said is true, then there's at least two superweapons in the city that the Foundation could deeply benefit from. Those colossus are… impressive. And, of course, the teleporter. Mekhane's Kiss.

ARAM: It's not… yes, sir. I'm going to need lots of supplies. Deuterium and tritium, most importantly. We're going to try and bring those cold fusion reactors online.

O5-11: That's a big ask. And a dangerous one. We'd like to know how the city was destroyed before we accidentally blow it up, hah.

ARAM: We've already mastered most of the technology we've discovered, and we do have Preserver to assist us still.

O5-11: SCP-001-A1, yes. Still…

ARAM: Discovering the city's defense - and how effective they are - is crucial to getting an accurate image of the battle. Right, Hedvig?

Progress on rebuilding the cold fusion reactors is progressing much, much faster than projections. Normally, I'd be worried, but I'm surprisingly calm.""")

The fuladh foundries are operating at amazing efficiency, we've worked out how to mold and shape the metal just how we need it, and what last year looked like a bizarre, nonsensical circuit structure and design philosophy now strikes me as beautifully idiosyncratic. A snapshot into a bygone era.

I've never really been one for history. More of a STEM type - I never looked down on those that pursued history. I just didn't see the attraction - machines are in front of you, something tangible you can see and hear and touch and interact with. You can't do that with history, not really.

The Fuladh Throne, of course, has changed that. I've spent lifetimes of ancient emperors in minutes. It's staggering. The depth of emotion and personality you can feel from only a few choice minutes in someone's body. Their grief, pain, joy, their story. Fascinating stuff. The technology of the Throne and any possible side effects remain elusive, but we've been testing it for a few weeks now, maybe a dozen times, and while I'm always tired after - not a surprise, at my age - I feel fine otherwise. And now I know Mekhanite, Greek, and Egyptian. Go figure.

I've gotten a front-seat view to the First War and it is… apocalyptic. There's really no other word for it. Gigantic mech suits crushing cities as the sky itself opens up? Spirit-demons fighting alongside human compatriots? Metal soldiers charging walls? Insanity. A secret, bloody history the world doesn't even remember. But as with all war, it's not quite so black-and-white.

Being inside Bumaro's - or, the various Bumaros' bodies - none of them were tyrants, or dictators. Maybe autocrats, but what emperor wasn't? They all wanted to protect their people, to raise them to something beyond human. I can't help but sympathize.""")

Speaking of implants and bionics, the cache we discovered some weeks ago along with the Legion armor; O5-11 denied D-class testing. It's frustrating. We can't use the glorious technology here to improve the world, we can't use it to improve ourselves, we can barely use it to improve the damn city. It's devastating, and most of the team agrees with me that we should use it.

So we did. I can't use D-class to test the implants, but using myself is a different matter. The new arm is… wonderful. It's smoother, more responsive, more sensitive and durable and it doesn't even hurt at the end of the day. I can sleep with it on. 99% of our personnel in Amoni-Ram are already augmented, so changing out their stainless steel arm for a fuladh one or something is no big deal. Why should Five be the only one that reaps the gifts the Mekhanites left us?

On July 29th, 2:05PM, Doctor Nussbaum and four members of the archaelogical team were excavating a number of mosaics in the undercity. Over the course of the day, the team progressed further inward, into an unstable section. The ceiling overhead suddenly gave way, causing a minor collapse. Due to a number of strength-enhancing bionic and cybernetic augments, the archaelogical team members were able to escape largely unharmed; however, Doctor Nussbaum sustained severe internal and external injuries from the collapse and was rushed into emergency surgery in the ARF-01 infirmary.

Due to the severity of injuries sustained - including a shattered collarbone, fractured spine, cranial injuries, and hemorrhaging - medical personnel were able to stabilize her in critical condition. Her likelihood of survival was deemed extremely low.""")

Evaluations by medical personnel provided insight into the enhancements offered by the Mekhanite augmentations. Internally, they integrated with her immune and nervous systems, offering fine, instinctual control and an increase in healing speed. Due to the relative lightness of the fuladh metalwork compared to steel, her body mass did not shift considerably. However, her strength, lift capacity, running speed, pull weight, and a suite of other measurements vastly increased in the weeks following her recovery. She similarly reported significant increases in her sensory ability, well beyond that given by her former Foundation-issue ocular and auditory implants.

NUSSBAUM: Y-yes. I am… in the palace. The city itself is shaking. The Legion is holding the palace against the horde. Bumaro is on the throne, with his wife. "My Lord, we must leave. They have taken three of the gates. We will not have a chance for much longer."

ARAM: He's not going to leave.

NUSSBAUM: No. He stands up - he is in his war armor, all gleaming gold and silver plate, big enough to block out the sky. He leans down. "You must go, sha-hashna."

ARAM: What did he say?

NUSSBAUM: "Sha-hashna". I do not recognize the word. It seems similar to the words for protect or guard…

ARAM: We can figure it out later.

ARAM: Wait…

NUSSBAUM: He is sitting in the same spot as the statue we found. Waiting, sword and spear in hand.

ARAM: Oh, holy shit. It's not a statue.

NUSSBAUM: I- I have left the palace. I am running across the city, to the nearest undercity entrance. The mass of the horde is still beyond the walls, but so many have breached the city. My blade sings, but I never stop. Slitting one's throat as I run past him. Gutting another beast. Crushing the skull of a Covenant summoner. There are so many. I must keep moving. I - okay. I have jumped into the undercity, sealing the entrance behind me. It is… different. Brightly lit, well-signed. Blood plastering the walls. Corpses lining the passageways. Oh God.

ARAM: Where are you going?

NUSSBAUM: To the center. Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth. I encounter resistance. The Covenant and Nälka's 'gifts' have made it down here. The plant-virus and the mutated flesh-pod-tentacles we have seen. But not petrified and dead. Alive. Throbbing. Wet. Many soldiers, moving through the undercity. They do not know the passages like we do. They are confused. They do not last long. There are many families hiding in rooms and warehouses and dormitories and barracks. I cannot help them now. All I can do is keep moving.

ARAM: Do you recognize any of the routes?

NUSSBAUM: It's… yes. I just rounded a familiar corner. I… yes, I know where we are going.

ARAM: Where?

NUSSBAUM: Preserver's chamber. SCP-001-A1. Under the palace itself. It takes some detours, but I arrive where it- what?

ARAM: What happened?

NUSSBAUM: It is not here. Preserver is not here. Just the masses of machinery, but no arm or mind or voice.""")

Making sure it works. I look at it - I seal the chamber door behind me. It is just me. I hear a boom from above, and begin stripping off my armor.

ARAM: Wait, what?

NUSSBAUM: I need to interface with- oh, God. I understand now.

ARAM: What?

NUSSBAUM: "Sha-hashna". It's close to guard and protect, but in a noun form. It means one who guards. A preserver.

ARAM: … Oh, fuck. That's why Preserver isn't there. Oh, fuck!

NUSSBAUM: I have disrobed. The armor lies in a heap. I reach out and touch-

NUSSBAUM: Yes. Yes. I can hear you. Oh, mein gott. That was horrible.

ARAM: What the fuck just happened?

NUSSBAUM: I touched the machine and just- agony. So much pain. I felt like someone was cutting me limb from limb. Burning my tongue off and branding my eyes. God.

ARAM: Are you okay? What do you see now?

NUSSBAUM: I- yes, I am fine. I see… I do not know what I am seeing. Rubble, debris. It is quiet. I- wait, I can move. No- yes, I can move, but I am… small.

ARAM: How small?

NUSSBAUM: I- I am inhabiting one of the automata.

ARAM: Just like how Preserver can control them. That settles that.

NUSSBAUM: I exit out into the city. I can see- oh, God. Oh no.

ARAM: What happened? What did the Kiss do?

NUSSBAUM: Everyone is dead.

ARAM: The horde?

NUSSBAUM: Everyone. There are corpses choking the streets. Not a free patch of dirt to be found. Dead bodies covering every possible surface, both my Legionnaires and the horde and the citizens. No explosive finishes. The quiet death of an entire civilization. Oh god. What have I done?

NUSSBAUM: They're all dead, Robert. I destroyed the empire trying to save it. Everyone I ever knew or loved. Everyone.

ARAM: Hedvig? You hear me?

NUSSBAUM: Robert. Yes. Thank you.

ARAM: Thought we lost you for a second there.

NUSSBAUM: It was… overwhelming.

ARAM: Yeah. But we learned a hell of a lot.

NUSSBAUM: Yes. Yes of course. God. No wonder Preserver cannot remember.

ARAM: What do you mean?

NUSSBAUM: She obliterated her own civilization while trying to save it. I had a taste of it for just a few seconds and it was too much to take. She has lived with that guilt for nearly three thousand years. Who wouldn't want to forget?

ARAM: You're saying she did it on purpose?

NUSSBAUM: I am no engineer, but if I were a betting woman…

[NUSSBAUM holds the cylinder to the light.]

NUSSBAUM: I would guess these cylinders are a memory-storage form of some sort. She placed her memories into this to get rid of them, but obviously when she rid herself of her memories - she forgot what it even was.

FROM THE DESK OF DOCTOR ROBERT ARAM
AMONI-RAM INITIATIVE
Personal log

This is ridiculous.

Preserver has been integral to the success of the Amoni-Ram Initiative. Far more so than any of the O5s arbitrating on whether she deserves to know her own identity. We wouldn't even have the throne if she hadn't led us to it and provided the Fist, the cylinders, everything. We owe her.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

And even if we didn't, it's the right thing to do. "Mad scientist" is possibly one of the dumbest stereotypes of all time - scientists have ethics. Even in Prometheus, where progress was done for the sake of progress, we had ethics. Expectations of behaviour and morality. Making sure everyone knew exactly what they were signing up for. Not withholding crucial discoveries fundamental to their sense of being. The Foundation is not scientists, it is bureaucrats - and bureaucrats are the ones who will do away with ethics for efficiency.

I shouldn't get this mad. But it just begs so many questions. It's representative of how they think of this project - not a font of tools to improve the world, but of information that needs to be suppressed and released when the world is ready. Visionaries do not wait for the world to be ready to present their idea, because the world is never ready. We force the world to change. In the 60s, augments were a rarity in the Foundation. Agents who got them were freaks. They were a last resort to maintain functionality. Then they realized we were better, faster, smarter, stronger. And look at us now. A project and two Sites staffed entirely by augmented personnel.

But they obviously don't trust Preserver, because she's a machine. Even though she's not, really. She was human once, but they can only think of her as a machine - to use, to exploit. The same way they think of me and Hedvig and Tenz and Zaid and all the others. They don't trust us either, not really. We've done more for them and gotten fuck all in return except the permission to rebuild what has been our home for nearly a year. It's frustrating.

I've been thinking about what SCP-001-A1 said. About the Throne. It's not true - there's no paratechnology that can force a psychic connection, that would require a staggering amount of power and all sorts of bullshit. But it makes me wonder. I've been probing Nussbaum, seeing if she responds like Preserver said she would.""")

If it is true - and I'm not saying it is - it would logically extend to the others, too. Did they all agree to swapping out their augments with the Mekhanite ones because it was what they wanted? Or was it because it was what I wanted them to do?

On September 30th, the O5 Council approved a plan allowing the involvement of SCP-001-A1 in the Siege of Amoni-Ram to be declassified to it, but withholding the details of its activation of Mekhane's Kiss and destruction of the city. Doctors Aram and Nussbaum entered its chamber the following day.

ARAM: Preserver.

NUSSBAUM: Hello again.

SCP-001-A1: WELCOME. IT HAS BEEN SOME TIME.

NUSSBAUM: Yes, our apologies.

ARAM: Regretfully, we had to ask our superiors for some things before we could have this conversation.

SCP-001-A1: YOUR SUPERIORS. ARE YOU BEHOLDEN TO THEM?

NUSSBAUM: Yes, in a way.

ARAM: Well, in any case, we can talk now. We performed the Throne test with the cylinder you provided. It was… illuminating.

SCP-001-A1: HAVE YOU LEARNT OF MY ORIGIN? MY HISTORY?

NUSSBAUM: We have, yes. The cylinder allowed me to tap into your memories. At least, we think they are your memories.

SCP-001-A1: YOU UTILIZED THE THRONE?

NUSSBAUM: Ah, yes. Is that… a problem?

[Pause.]

SCP-001-A1: NO. CONTINUE.

NUSSBAUM: Yes, well. We encountered the memories of an individual seen repeatedly by Robert in Bumaro's memories. A female soldier, one of the Legion's generals. Likely favored by Bumaro due to their close personal relationship. Advising the younger king militarily during the First War, with campaigns into the East in all directions.

SCP-001-A1: I… SEE.

NUSSBAUM: We also discovered what happened to the city, in the end.

SCP-001-A1: TELL ME.""")

NUSSBAUM: It was besieged by a united force of the Nälka and the Covenant of the Daeva as well as an appearance by the Abominate.

SCP-001-A1: IT IS KNOWN. WHAT MORE HAVE YOU LEARNT? HOW DID THEY DEFEAT US?

NUSSBAUM: The Legion was marching on Black Adytum at the time, hoping to end the war decisively - the colossi and the home army were the only ones left to defend Amoni-Ram. They used biological weapons, viruses, to attack the city and kill the Legionnaires and civilians. The city was lost as soon as the first colossus fell.

SCP-001-A1: DID I SERVE MY EMPIRE?

ARAM: Yes. You served your king and your people. You were instrumental in the defense of the city - both before and after the walls fell. You also tried to evacuate Bumaro and Hedara, but he sent you away. As Amoni-Ram burned, you had a different mission.

NUSSBAUM: Robert…

ARAM: You were told to hold the North Gate at all costs. Give the civilians a chance to escape the destruction. And you did. As the horde swept over the walls and slaughtered everything in their path, you held the gate against a thousand and a thousand more sorcerers and spirits and flesh-beasts. The only reason people escaped the massacre.

SCP-001-A1: THEY FLED? MEKHANITES WALK THE EARTH TODAY?

ARAM: It's possible. Thanks to you.

Hello Jamil,

ARAM: I'm fine. Just spent a little bit of time tinkering with the Throne.

NUSSBAUM: What?

ARAM: Relax, nothing serious. Just some investigation, based on some things Preserver told me.

NUSSBAUM: What did you find?

ARAM: I'm not sure yet. There's some latent psychokinetic energy emanating from it, but we've been aware of that for a while. Just not sure what it means.

NUSSBAUM: What kind of energy?

ARAM: Not sure. But it's gotten stronger recently. With every use of the Throne, seems like.

ARAM: I don't know how I'm going to go back to bunking on Site dormitories after this, hah.

NUSSBAUM: I am unsure I want to. Foundation politics tire me, and they are omnipresent in the larger Sites. Amoni-Ram is nicer. Everyone here is here because they want to do the work.

ARAM: Agreed. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.

NUSSBAUM: Yes?

ARAM: I think we may need to shift gears a bit, in terms of what we're focusing on, you know?

NUSSBAUM: I… don't follow.

ARAM: At this point we're pretty much confident in the timeline of what happened to Amoni-Ram. But the other nations, and the Abominate, we know nothing about them except the battle. So I think it could be beneficial if we focus more on the weapons, the technology used during the Siege. Put the mundane archaeology aside for a little while.

ARAM: I didn't say anything!

PoI-001-A Personnel File

0 to a wealthy American family mainly settled within New York. Being an only son, he was always meant to inherit the family fortune and their industrial empire consisting of numerous industrial plants once the current holders — his father and mother — inevitably died. Highly interested in the history of Fae (Homo sapiens sidhe) and Children of the Night (Homo sapiens noctis) ever since his childhood, Rollander had always shown an above-average intelligence, near-perfect memory, and skill in obtaining historical information otherwise thought to be undiscoverable.

However, when a majority of his family died under unexplained circumstances in 1888 during a fatal shipboard incident (for which he was not present, but had personally financed), PoI-001-A donated all of his stocks and buildings to an unknown thaumaturgic cabal operating in the USA.

The next day James Rollander was seen leaving America with a ship headed for Great Britain, later traveling to (at that time occupied) Poland.""")

Having disappeared for approximately 10 years following the conclusion of his travels, he reappeared in 1898 near Kraków, Poland, with the construction of SCP-001-A starting shortly after.

SCP-001-A is an industrial megastructure located 75 kilometers north of Kraków, Poland, founded and overseen by James Rollander. Acting as the main provider of a plethora of services to the entire country and most of the continent, it currently houses approximately 30 000 laborers working and living within its confines. Atop its gates the following sentence, written in the Fae language, can be seen:

The Factory hungers, as the Queen’s move has become her last gambit. Do not leave it in famine.

SCP-001-B is a room located within SCP-001-A, which can only be found once an individual expresses the wish to find it, be it willingly or subconsciously. So far, attempts to mark it in relation to any other rooms or landmarks within the structure have been unsuccessful; inevitably, all individuals coming into contact with it will describe drastically different details of the place and the path which led them to it.

SCP-001-C is an entity located within SCP-001-B, fed by human sacrifices delivered to it by PoI-001-A. Further details regarding its nature are presently unavailable.

Discovery: SCP-001-A was constructed by a currently unidentified group of individuals or force between 1898-1902; no formal records regarding the process of construction exist. Created as the "ultimate factory," it was meant to supply every single possible industrial need of the people.

To eliminate the possibility that the event was merely a coincidence precipitated by the building's potentially anomalous location, further research was approved. This resulted in the discovery of the ruins of numerous palaces and city structures in the caverns below the factory. Dated at approximately 200 000 years old, they were immediately identified as structures formed by the Fae Empire prior to its fall.2 Despite their anomalous properties, it was later discovered that they had been uninvolved with the event, which had instead been the result of some form of ritual conducted within SCP-001-A.

Following these discoveries, the Foundation officially classified SCP-001-A as its first full high-priority project following the adoption of the 'SCP' classification, resulting in it acquiring the designation of SCP-001.

Addendum 001-1: SCP-001-A Exploration

In light of the thaumaturgic energy's failure to fade, the O5 Council decided that more information regarding SCP-001-A was required. As no SCP-001-A personnel were noted leaving the factory within the previous month, a Foundation-organized exploration mission was orchestrated.

However, upon entry into the factory, the Task Force immediately lost contact with the Foundation.

Addendum 001-2: SCP-001-A Ruins Analysis

Following the loss of contact with previous exploration missions, it was decided that further exploration attempts would inevitably end the same way.

The Two Great Diasporas

The following is a full timeline of the history of human, Fae, and Children of Night conflicts and all events leading to the Two Great Diasporas, as compiled by O5-4. As most of the historical records acting as evidence for these events are either extremely old or severely damaged, precise Gregorian Calendar dates cannot be traced. Approximate dates are given instead.

[UNKNOWN] — consensus baseline reality achieves stability as the result of numerous religious faiths being simultaneously true (due to human belief bestowing power upon them). "Old Gods" and numerous other deific entities presumably responsible for the creation and destruction of the era fade away, leaving Earth to its own machinations — no further outside influence on history is noted from this point forth.
300 000 years BCE — humans, Fae, and Children of the Night emerge as the three dominant species on the planet, evolving from one (currently unknown) common evolutionary predecessor. As humans live in the plains during the day, the Fae hide in the forests where nature reigns; the remaining Nightwalkers exist in caverns.
280 000 years BCE — Queen Mab and her sister (name unknown — all references are anomalously expunged from the record, with similar energy markings to the removal of one's name) are born. Utilizing their nigh-limitless ontokinetic and thaumaturgic abilities, they establish a vast empire, connecting all Fae as one nation ruled by the two. Children of the Night create numerous underground cities, and humans remain as nomadic tribes.

275 000 years BCE — as the two queens' control over their abilities grows to near full understanding, the Fae empire expands worldwide, taking control over both humans and Nightwalkers.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The former are put into gigantic habitats, unaware of their situation and observed by Fae royalty as entertainment, whilst the latter's cities are destroyed and their inhabitants sent to the darkness of the mines to work as slaves. The divide between the Fae poor and the aristocrats grows exponentially as the royalty gains power through the exploitation of the working class, treated similarly to the prisoners.
240 000 years BCE — an all-out war between the two factions of the Fae empire breaks out, with Queen Mab and her sister standing on opposite sides, divided by moral issues. Utilizing her vastly greater power of ontokinetic abilities and the skill to take away Names, Mab swings the conflict in favor of the Fae royalty. Exploiting the chaos, Children of the Night break free, uniting with humanity and eventually bringing the conflict to the end by raiding the palaces of the royalty. Mab murders her sister, but temporarily loses her power in the process, allowing for the rebellion to eliminate her. The Fae empire falls, with its subjects scattering around the globe. Children of the Night become the dominant species, ending the First Great Diaspora.
220 000 years BCE — the Nightwalkers create vast, technologically advanced metropolises, coexisting harmoniously with nature. Humanity once again becomes a protected, zoo-like species. Through unknown means, Queen Mab survives between several afterlives, eventually gaining insight into baseline reality.
210 000 years BCE — Queen Mab persuades humanity to overthrow the Children of the Night, lending them some of her remaining power. Together with the remaining Fae, humanity and its newfound allies destroys the SCP-1000 civilization, eventually wiping their memories of the event. The Second Great Diaspora, also referred to as the Day of the Flowers, makes humanity the dominant species.""")

SCP-001-A Ruins Analysis
A paper by O5-43

When I first arrived at the dig site beneath SCP-001-A, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't expecting the usual findings — that being yet another gigantic ruined palace of Mab, brought down by the furious First Diasporans desperately trying to find the monster behind their suffering. And, in a sense, I was right; the building was in fact yet another fortress of the devil Mab is, but this time it was… different. What we found was, frankly, shocking.

One room after another, we uncovered the secrets that place had held for so many millennia after the First Slaughter, and, well, after months of relentless work and making sure our interpretations were accurate, we have to come to one final conclusion that we are almost afraid to mutter: she still breathes somewhere outside our reality, biding her time. Just like her sibling.

We've always thought the other died, trying to stop her monstrous sister — however, evidence recovered from the SCP-001-A ruins singlehandedly debunks this. We checked all our calculations and interpretations to make sure we're not wrong, for this could change everything.

What's even more shocking is that the sister is not only alive, but also active; just like Mab has her own cults trying to find a ritual capable of resurrecting her, so does the sibling. We however discovered something even more alarming: the names of the sisters. Not true names, of course, for the second sister does not even own hers anymore — but we did discover… half-names, would be the best way to put it. Words not fully describing the very being of a person, as true Fae names do, but descriptors of important parts of their personalities.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" For Mab, long associated with lies and deceit, it was "shvygh" and "shfijifæ," meaning "queen" and "starlight" respectively, but for the sister, associated with creation and aid, "nv̄nvŋ́nfat" and "pitfḿje," which, upon translation, meant "inventor" and… "factory."

What's even more alarming is the event that led to the thaumaturgic energy explosion within SCP-001-A. You see, upon further inspection, my teams discovered many truly bizarre signs: high Akiva radiation, as well as a single sentence woven into the rituals binding the room that would eventually become SCP-001-B into our reality:

Come, Inventor; come, our Factory. The Queen is ready. Do not leave her waiting.

And so, it appears, Rollander quite literally called forth a factory. A factory to resurrect the true Factory through regular human sacrifice.

Identical ritual parts were detected in the magic which created the factory in the first place. What's more, my men report the feeling that these two rituals were merely two parts of a three-act performance. Whatever the hell Rollander did to bring his masterpiece and the room within to life was merely preparation for bringing a third thing, this time presumably an entity, from within it and into our reality.

Mab has been a danger lurking behind our backs for almost 40 years now, ever since we founded ourselves in those dark halls, swearing to protect humanity from a Third Diaspora that would bring us down again. We did everything we could to stop Mab's influence, but let's face it: our best magicians won't even form a fraction of the power that devil possesses. But the sister does. And we need to do everything in our power to use that to our advantage.

What I'm trying to say is that I believe SCP-001-B isn't merely a room — it's a throne room, designed to host royalty.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Whatever god resides there — and let's call it SCP-001-C, for simplicity's sake — I can feel its hatred for Mab pumping through the veins of the Factory, coming from the pounding heart seated within. And I know only of one entity that hates Mab more than the Nightwalkers.

We must use this opportunity as best as we can, unless we wish for another genocide to hit, this time targetting us.

Addendum 001-3: Further Research and Changes

Two months following the conclusion of the SCP-001-A ruins research, the news regarding it was apparently leaked by an unknown individual to the worldwide anomalous community. Numerous rumors resulted, and as a result, Fae militia organizations were seen taking interest in the factory. This news reached the ever-growing group supporting Mab's actions and planning her resurrection.

In the coming weeks, their squads were noted to patrol the outskirts of the factory, apparently seeking to gain access. Successfully doing so, they were then seen sabotaging SCP-001-A, resulting in significant damage to the building. To counteract this action, Rollander decided to double the sacrifice rate towards SCP-001-C, resulting in an extremely high disappearance rate among workers within Kraków and surrounding cities. This led to local authorities gaining interest in the case. To counteract a possible Veil-breaking event, on 03/02/1910, the Administrator sent the following urgent message to Rollander:

Honorable James Rollander,

We are aware of your actions within your factory, and, whilst we realize and appreciate your intentions of keeping Mab at bay through the resurrection of the Inventor, we must ask for an immediate cessation of such activities. We realize that you are left with no other option than to increase your sacrifices following the attacks, but we simply cannot allow you to continue doing so; the only alternative you realistically have is to properly deal with the attacks and continue your work at a normal pace.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" We hope you will understand our concerns and express a wish to cooperate, for we will engage with force otherwise.

With respect,
— Kraków authorities

Two days later, the following reply was received by the O5 Council; how PoI-001-A was aware of the location of its members remains unknown.

Silence, foul creatures of darkness. My noble heart shan't listen to your laughable heresies — I can hear the Queen speaking through your words. And, I want you to know one thing — I am no Starlight's servant. I swore loyalty to only one Inventor, to one brilliant mind illuminating the skies with its genius like your Star had never had. I forgive your vengeful hearts serving Mab, for the creator forgives, unlike your Queen. Begone, whilst your armies can still walk.

My Masterpiece is almost done, and I shan't stop with its preparations — if you wish for a war with our magic, then you shall have it. The Factory is almost ready to emerge, and once it does, her brilliance shall overpower the darkness your Empress wished for the entire world. You cannot stop the rituals feeding Her, for the Inventor can feel your every move. She whispers to my ear, illuminating my mind with a portion of its brilliance, and I know of all you do — of your horrid servitude to the betrayer of the men of this Earth.

May the Skies above us have mercy on you.

You will not stop us.

Immediately after, PoI-001-A took the following actions:

tripled the intake of workers to SCP-001-A, effectively resulting in the tripling of the ratio of the rituals feeding SCP-001-C;
neutralized numerous Mab-aligned Fae organizations, bringing their bodies into SCP-001-A for purposes unknown;
utilized numerous thaumaturgic rituals within SCP-001-A, disallowing entry into the building without his direct permission;
hastened the shipment of unknown thaumaturgic and theological apparatus into the factory.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""
Realizing the only way to neutralize the threat of the breaking of the Veil due to Rollander's actions whilst still maintaining the protection from PoI-001-C was taking control of SCP-001-A, Overwatch Command had undertaken the following vote:

Proposal: "Utilize Foundation resources to seize SCP-001-C from James Rollander and establish a Site within. Effectively gain control over the protection from PoI-001-C offered by sacrifices to SCP-001-C whilst still maintaining the secretive nature of the SCP Foundation's operations."

ADMINISTRATOR'S NOTE4
When, all those years ago, I brought the thirteen talented mages and theologists that would eventually become my Council before myself, I swore one thing — to never resort to meaningless violence. For all those 40 years we've operated together now, I stayed true to my promise — even if I was among the few of us that did keep it, I kept it. Never have I approved an operation that would result in the deaths of people who didn't need to die for the world to become safe. But times have changed.

If you'd told me 40 years ago I would be approving, nay, even suggesting a military raid that would result in the deaths of factory workers to contain a single threat, I'd call you a madman. But it must be done. We simply cannot allow ourselves to lose the only known mechanism to defend against Mab in the entire universe. We must strike quickly and ruthlessly, because we need to keep Mab away from baseline reality, no matter what it takes. Such are the demands the greater good makes upon us, no matter our personal opinions.

I'm truly sorry, but there is no other way.

Addendum 001-4: SCP-001-A Raid

Following the mobilization of all available Foundation forces within the area of SCP-001-A, on 27/02/1910, the SCP Foundation officially began a military attack on SCP-001-A. The following is a transcript of [ERROR]'s only memory of the event, verified as safe for public viewing due to numerous memetic triggers present within his memory, as provided by a ritual conducted by Maria Jones.

Date: 27/02/1910

Subject: SCP-001-A

Present Parties:

PoI-001-A;
[ERROR];5
O5-4;
O5-8.
Foreword: Due to the protective field set-up within [ERROR]'s memories, the following was the only memetic-trigger-free memory of the event available for harvest without causing damage to its host. As a result of only partial removal to ensure [ERROR]'s safety, the following transcript is unclear and describes only one very specific fragment of the SCP-001-A raid.

[BEGIN LOG]

The feed begins as O5-8 is standing outside the entrance to PoI-001-A's office. Her hands are extended widely, just 5 centimeters away from the doors to the room, and she is visibly struggling in deep focus. She opens her deep and burning purple eyes6 and, with a silent scream, tears the doors apart, revealing entry into the office. Panting, she nods towards the rest of the group, made up of [ERROR] and O5-4, and they enter into it.

The room is extremely large and packed with numerous bookcases, chests, and containers, with magical items of unknown purpose scattered throughout. In the corner, behind a large wooden desk, Rollander is cowering. He is shivering, with a shadow formation akin to a crown forming above his head. Sobbing, in a panicked state, he attempts to hide from the intruders behind the chair.

O5-8: <in a powerful tone:> JAMES JOSEPH ROLLANDER.

PoI-001-A screams, falling to the ground. The shadows above him start to disappear; noticing this, Rollander panics. He attempts to grab the formation, but fails, eventually losing all of it.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" He starts to scour the floor around him, looking for something, frantically talking to himself but finding nothing.

O5-8 comes closer, extending her hand. Rollander notices this, and widens his eyes.

Rollander: No no no no no, no no. No. No no, no!

O5-8: COME FORWARD, AND ANSWER FOR YOUR CRIMES.

Rollander throws a book at Eight, who easily deflects it with ontokinesis. She comes closer yet again, and snaps her fingers. PoI-001-A starts to levitate, unable to move.

Rollander: No! <weakly:> She… she said… it will end… differently…

Eight smiles, clenching her fist. Rollander starts to choke, grabbing his throat in a panicked manner, but seconds later falls on the ground, his eyes burning with a bright green. He frees himself of the power holding him back through unknown means, moving towards O5-8.

Rollander: <in a hoarse tone:> THE LIGHT OF THE THOUSAND-DAWN EMPIRE SHALL NOT F— AGH!

He blinks, suddenly falling to the ground again. When he reopens his eyes, they are normal, and he does not seem to realize what just happened. Eight groans, throwing him like a ragdoll onto the wall. Her nose starts to bleed profusely.

[ERROR]: Mary, I think that's eno—

Eight screams in anger as she throws PoI-001-A around the room, smashing him against any and all obstacles in her path.

[ERROR]: THAT'S ENOUGH!

The overseer suddenly stops, panting aggressively. She is bleeding from every orifice, but does not seem to notice nor care. Instead, with visible exhaustion in her eyes, she turns towards [ERROR].

[ERROR]: <quietly:> What the fuck was that? What the hell's gotten into you?! You were supposed to not kill him, for god's sake, we can't just murder people!

O5-8: You can't murder people.

Eight grabs herself by the head, groaning silently.

O5-8: God, I… I don't know, I… Something here is… I… I…

They are suddenly interrupted by O5-4 grabbing the half-alive Rollander by his jacket, pulling his face close. Four spits on him. Rollander does not react, silently sobbing.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

O5-4: You… disgust me.

Four heads for the exit, carrying the broken PoI-001-A with him. However, as he is about to reach the rest of the group, Rollander's body suddenly explodes with shadows and smoke, causing the Overseer to drop him. Four screams, backing off, as a singular, burning green eye blinks from within the expanding smoke.

[UNKNOWN]: <coming from within the smoke, in a hoarse tone:> COME HOME, MY CHILD. COME HOME AND SUFFER NO MORE.

The smoke suddenly clears, revealing that PoI-001-A's body has disappeared; where it once laid, only his clothing remains to be seen. O5-4 inhales sharply, and turns towards the rest of the group.

O5-4: [ERROR]?

[ERROR]: Yes?

O5-4: Tell the people the factory has fallen.

[END LOG]

Afterword: Following the events described above, the SCP Foundation had officially taken control of the factory.

To fully discuss further actions following the above, a summit of the O5 Council was called. Further containment and research plans regarding SCP-001 were discussed, eventually landing on the necessity of a Site within the anomaly's proximity to properly contain it. As a result, a proposal was put forward by O5-1 to, over a long period of time, transform the gigantic structure of SCP-001-A into a Foundation Site, acting as the main hub of operations for the Council and its most important project: SCP-001.

Addendum 001-5: Further SCP-001 Research

Following the stabilization of the threat of potential civilian discovery of SCP-001-A due to Rollander's decisions and the finalization of Site-01's construction, the O5 Council decided that research into the true nature of SCP-001-B and SCP-001-C as well as the latter's protective nature against PoI-001-C was a priority.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Despite previous studies showcasing the fact that SCP-001-C is most likely the half-dead entity referred to as 'The Inventor', further study conducted by O5-4 and his teams revealed that the entity was connected to numerous Fae seers and thaumaturgists in the world, still capable of communication.

However, despite the aforementioned stabilization, attacks from local Queen Mab-affiliated militias did not stop, instead increasing in frequency; the Foundation attempted contact with said groups on numerous occasions, but the only answer ever received was the following:

You will not bring her back. Not after everything we've done to try to stop it.

Chatter picked up by Foundation moles situated within communities around the world suggested that a "Fae army, like the world has never seen since the dawn of Mab" was gathering to attack SCP-001-A. Initially dismissed as mere rumors, this eventually led to the Foundation tripling security measures around Site-01 after numerous previously stationary Fae groups went on the move. Further research into this phenomenon remained pending at the time.

In the meantime, research into SCP-001-C was officially approved. After months of analysis, it was officially confirmed that following sacrifices to SCP-001-C being done, the percent of Queen Mab's entire being existing in baseline reality did in fact seem to reduce from 5% to 4%, rendering all previous interpretations to be true.

In order to utilize the fact that SCP-001-C, presumed to be Queen Mab's sibling, was still alive and able to communicate, the following tests were undertaken.""")

Addendum 001-6: Site-01 Raid

On 13/08/1911, Site-01 thaumaturges suddenly detected a gigantic mass incoming, manifesting into the plains around SCP-001-A via a portal ritual. The ritual was nearing completion, with the portal approximated to contain individuals numbering in the thousands; a 2-hour window to prepare for the army's arrival was projected. When evacuation was ordered, the area around the building was almost immediately cut off via a thaumaturgic barrier. Numerous anti-magic apparatus set up around the Site did not appear to slow the ritual.

A Site-wide alert was immediately called, with the entire Council immediately evacuated to the lower levels and appropriate personnel called to duty. A distress call to other Foundation Sites was attempted, but due to no such facilities existing within Poland, no aid was possible within the given time span. Site-01 staff began to prepare for the incoming attack, attempting to eavesdrop on the teleporting army's conversations, yielding the below result.

[ERROR] is frantically running through the numerous corridors of SCP-001-A, constantly looking back, trying to see if anyone is following him. All around him lie numerous corpses — some of them with broken necks — and the floors of the factory are covered in blood. He is shivering. He eventually finds a dead-end he can hide in; he covers his mouth, trying not to make a sound, and closes his eyes, trying to stop the panic.

Footsteps can be heard from the outside hallway as [ERROR] starts to sob, attempting to remain silent. The footsteps eventually stop as shadows just outside the gap he is hiding in appear. Neither of the figures seems to notice the entrance to [ERROR]'s hiding place.

He suddenly opens his eyes, looking around the room with an unconscious stare. He is no longer within the same space he'd occupied minutes ago, now lying on the cold floors of a short corridor ending in gigantic green doors, which stand open. Green smoke is pouring out of the doors, encompassing him and his surroundings in an ominous aura. From within the room beyond, a silent whisper akin to that of an animal fills the air.

The Founding of the SCP Foundation

Originally founded in 1870 following the conclusion of the Sixth Occult War as an evolution of a group researching thaumaturgy, theology, and the history of the Two Great Diasporas, created by some of the thirteen of the richest and most influential men and women of their time, led by one individual — [ERROR]. The SCP Foundation was created with three goals in mind: to Secure the human population from Fae and SCP-1000 attacks, Contain the threat of Queen Mab and the gods of the ancient past, and Protect humanity from a Third Great Diaspora. The Foundation's motto would eventually be adapted from these goals.

Prior to the 1870 summit, plans to integrate the numerous subgroups into one organization were passed among the leaders who would eventually comprise the original O5 Council. Only following that year's discovery that Queen Mab was still alive, however, prompted by research made due to the conclusion of the aforementioned war, was it officially signed. This single discovery proved that research alone wouldn't be enough to deal with the existential threats hanging above humanity, and that a containment policy limiting their spread would eventually become necessary.""")

O5-4: —If you really believe such a thing as 'the greater good' exists. then you truly are a bigger fool than I ever expected.

[ERROR]: <firmly:> Go, before I remove you from more than just this room.

O5-4 opens the doors leading out of the hall, and spits on the floor.

O5-4: You… disgust me.

Four walks out of the room.

Afterword: Due to his behavior during the summit, O5-4 was officially removed from the SCP-001 project by direct order of [ERROR]; refusing to elaborate on the incident, he simply left Site-01 without a word, later found reporting from one of his research sites in North America.""")

Addendum 001-7: Results of the Third Diaspora

Following the information about the Foundation causing the Third Diaspora reaching the public, and, by extension, Foundation personnel, resignations have reached the highest rate ever recorded. Espionage and betrayal amongst Foundation personnel has increased by almost 10%, with overall efficiency down by approximately 40% even two years after the event.

Throughout the entirety of the post-Diaspora period a severe decrease in the mental stability of numerous Foundation staff, including Maria Jones and [ERROR], has been noted. The most notable case is the aforementioned Administrator, seen engaging in highly uncharacteristic behavior while denying any personal peculiarity. Examples included, but were not limited to:

erratic decisions without authorization from the rest of the Council;
visible obsession with the occult, despite little to no previous interest in such;
visible obsession with Fae history, despite little to no previous interest in such;
paranoia and trust issues;
patterns of talking to himself on seemingly nonsensical subjects.
Said behavior culminated on 30/12/1913 when [ERROR] disappeared, the only evidence left being the following note found on his desk:

'It' had never been the Inventor. How could I have been so blind?

The only contextual evidence Foundation thaumaturgists have found is an almost unnoticeable mark of magic leading towards SCP-001-B from [ERROR]'s office. The following is the only memory visualization available in the thaumaturgic thoughtspace near SCP-001-B that in any way references the event.

Date: Unknown

Subject: Unknown

Foreword: The truthfulness of the following is still pending approval from the rest of the O5 Council.

[ERROR] is standing in a short and dimly lit corridor, panting. He is holding the same stone he had used to cause the Third Diaspora in his hand, pointing it at the gigantic green doors in front of him.""")

[ERROR]: You… m-monster!

He comes closer, opening the doors with visible difficulty. As he finishes doing so, powerful wind starts to blow from inside, making him back off. He points the item at the inside of the room, from which green fog is rolling into the area around him.

[ERROR]: We… we fed you!

The sound of something stirring within the room fills the air as [ERROR] grabs his head in his hands. He screams with pain, falling on the floor. [UNKNOWN] laughs.

[ERROR]: What… what even are you?!

[ERROR] loses his words, breaking down in tears. He loses hold of the stone, letting it fall on the ground as his entire body shivers.

[UNKNOWN]: <chuckles> DOES THAT EVEN TRULY MATTER?

[ERROR] is suddenly lifted from the ground as green fills his eyes, making him scream. As he continues to do so, he is transported into SCP-001-B.

[UNKNOWN]: COME.

From underneath [ERROR]'s jacket, animal-like fur starts to explode, eventually filling his entire body. His face distorts, visibly deforming. His continued screaming eventually turns into the gurgling of a hog. He tries to reach for an exit, grabbing one of the doors, but his hands slip away as they turn into hooves. He eventually loses all voice, but the screaming continues as his now fully-converted body begins to twitch violently. The feed disconnects.

Afterword: No such individual with the name "[ERROR]" was ever a part of the Foundation's personnel. Following a second appearance of such an error following the initial SCP-001-A exploration and the above event, it was decided that it was the effect of SCP-001-C and should be ignored to maintain documentation logic.

Due to months of no contact with [ERROR] (likely the previous name for the Foundation's Administrator), as well as the nature of the above event, he was presumed dead.""")

Addendum 001-8: Post-Incident Stabilization Attempts

As requested by the remaining members of Overwatch Command, now not limited by [ERROR]'s influence, further research into the consequences of the Third Diaspora revealed that despite the 85% of the previously existing Fae populace being murdered, the remaining 15% did not fade, instead forming communities within Nexuses and Free Ports around the globe. No contact with them was attempted at the time of discovery, for obvious reasons.

Following the death of [ERROR] in unknown circumstances at the hands of SCP-001-C, the position of the Administrator remained vacant for a significant period of time; to properly deal with this problem as well as the consequences of the Third Diaspora following the death of its perpetrator, a meeting of the O5 Council was called.

Foreword: As, at the time of recording, the position of Administrator remained vacant, no supreme leadership over the Foundation was granted to any individual; despite this, the Council unanimously agreed a summit was necessary, without any outside pressure to attend.

[BEGIN LOG]

O5-11 enters into the now-fully renewed hall of the Council's meetings. Where once had been the damaged office of the now-deceased PoI-001-A is a room filled with Foundation maps, iconography, items of research, and contact apparatus. Among this can be seen a large wooden table with 13 seats, around which 8 visibly tired and saddened individuals are sitting. They are reading letters and other documents on the table. Eleven hurries to the table, clears his throat, and joins the remainder of the Council members in his seat.

O5-11: Apologies for the delay; Ontokinetics needed my assistance. Shall we begin?

He looks at O5-1, who nods.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Eleven smiles almost unnoticeably, nodding back, and he stands up from his seat, looking at the remainder of the Council.

O5-11: <sigh> I… I'm not going to play around the problem; [ERROR] is dead, as you all know, and, well, with him being gone, so is the position of Administrator.

O5-4 groans.

O5-4: And so too, the defenses for what he’s done.

O5-11: Yes, that too.

O5-11 pauses for a moment, trying to find his words; after failing to do so, he grabs his forehead with his right hand, gently massaging it, and sighs.

O5-11: What I'm ultimately trying to say is that we fucked up. Jesus Christ have we fucked up. We need an Administrator and a way to fix all of this goddamned mess. And we need one now.

Dead silence fills the room as Eleven exhales loudly.

O5-11: So, uhm, any ideas?

The silence is broken by the quiet humming of O5-2's mechanisms as he stands up. The turning clockwork fills the void left by the intrusion.

O5-2: MEKHANE ONCE SAID THAT TO BEAR TOTAL POWER WELL, ONE MUST BE OBJECTIVE IN ORDER TO BE JUST.

Two looks around the room.

O5-2: THEREFORE, HUMANITY IS UNABLE TO RULE WELL. TO DEAL WITH—

O5-4 coughs theatrically.

O5-4: No. I'm not giving a goddamned Mekhanite power over the rest of us. <pointing at O5-2:> That wasn't the deal with your little master when we built you.

O5-2: I—

O5-11: Friends, please.

As silence fills the room again, O5-1, who remained both silent and inactive during prior activities, suddenly clears his throat.

O5-1: I will take it.

O5-11: Huh?

O5-1: No matter how you think about it, the position of Administrator isn't a blessing. <sigh> And I'm the only one here who's too tired to use that curse in any way that would destroy us. I'm an old man, Joseph. You can wage your little wars as much as you want — but I'm only here to keep the destruction to a minimum.

Eleven tries to speak up, but decides against it. He sighs, and sits down, looking at the rest of the Council.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

O5-11: Anyone against?

No one reacts, silently looking on the ground.

O5-11: So it's decided.

One stands up again, throwing the document he's been holding in his hands on the desk. O5-11 raises his eyebrow.

O5-11: And that is…?

O5-1: The results of the Third Diaspora, in numbers.

O5-2: I FAIL TO SEE HOW THAT IS RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC OF OUR MEETING.

O5-1: It's relevant, Two, because we have to admit to what we've done.

O5-2: I BEG YOUR PARDON?

O5-1: We need to fix what we've done, do you understand? Even if [ERROR] had done so, we were one of the reasons it happened, and I'm not about to allow for my first action to be avoiding the consequences of our crimes.

Short pause.

O5-1: So, to put it simply, what the hell do we do?

Eleven raises his hand.

O5-11: Free Ports. We… We need to find them. Find them, and protect them the best we can do. And, perhaps one day, they might even not want to kill us.

O5-8 scratches her head.

O5-8: The last I heard about them was when we discovered that one in Wisconsin. And I don't think they have Fairies in there.

O5-4: There's been… rumors of one here in Poland, mostly Fae operated. 'Esterberg', it's supposedly called. My teams recover more and more records of it being a safe heaven for the anomalous, something like that. And there's always Hy-Brasil.

O5-1: Is this… confirmed?

Four scratches his chin.

O5-4: As close as we can get with a rumor, I suppose. But… establishing a Site wouldn't hurt anyone there. We needed one in Poland anyways. <turning towards Eleven:> Hasn't Hannah Rivera been keen on making one recently?

O5-11: She… She has, yes.

O5-4: So, what's the problem?

O5-2: WE CANNOT JUST ALLOW THINGS TO CHANGE IMMEDIATELY. IT WOULD BE SUSPICIOUS, AND PERSONNEL WOULD REBEL. APPROVING OF HER REQUEST AFTER DENYING IT FOR SO LONG WOULD BE UNWISE.

O5-1: Two's right. We need to take our time. Let's send her there, and if she finds something, only then let's allow her Site to happen.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" It would be… what, our one-hundred-twentieth?

Four smiles.

O5-4: And then, once she finds that Esterberg, let's start slowly, until we can fix things. But it will need time. We can't rush this. Sixty years at least.

O5-8: Sixty years? Have you lost your mind? That's more than half a century—

O5-11: We have time.

One sighs.

O5-1: We can't just make this a one-time thing. We must change our directives, not the ways in which people perceive them.

O5-4: Nobody can know this, aside from us. Not now, at least; people will resign if they learn of this now. Let's pretend to stay ruthless still, until we can truly change, giving into that change one step yearly.

O5-2: IT WILL NEED TO BECOME OUR FOURTH MOTTO. SECURING, CONTAINING, AND PROTECTING ARE NO LONGER THE VALID WAY.

Four chuckles silently.

O5-4: A fourth directive? Why not.

Passionate chatter spawns among the Council, which is quickly stopped by Eleven standing up and clearing his throat.

O5-11: Let's… Let's put it to a vote, shall we?

APPROVED (8-0-0)
Result: Further codenamed "Directive Alpha/1911," the foregoing proposal has been accepted and set as the unofficial subdirective to the SCP Foundation (among its known directives "to Secure, Contain, and Protect") available in full only to the O5 Council. All Foundation resources are made available to ensure the procedure's proper maintenance.

Following the unanimous passing of the proposal, making amends with the Fae populace has officially started. However, to ensure the continued compliance of Foundation personnel and to not precipitate any resignations due to drastic policy changes, the full process was projected to take over 70 years to complete. Calculations by O5-2 determined that the best way to integrate Fae and SCP-1000 cultures into human societies and structures, allowing for peaceful and harmonious coexistence would be gradual and small changes, eventually leading to total integration and, perhaps, the removal of the Foundation as a factor altogether. This process began with the founding of Site-120 to oversee Esterberg, the Free Port of Częstochowa.

However, despite these changes being attempted and, over time, amplified, not all anomalous societies have shown support, with some going as far as violence to oppose them. The most active was and remains to this day GoI-120 ("Triumviraté"15), formed amongst the chaos that ensued following the Factory Purge — as the Third Diaspora was later called — by the followers of Mab which remained after their slaughter. On the day of its inception, theorized to be within two weeks of 13/08/1911, the original date of the Third Diaspora, the group sent out a message to all Site-01 personnel which resulted in their discovery. A transcript of the message, translated from Fae and without the memetic triggers the original possessed, is available below.""")

It's quite funny, seeing your organization and the little Council managing it believing itself to be in control.

We've seen that attitude ever since we formed in the bowels of the Earths all those hundreds of thousands of years ago — hubris, that's what we called it. Hubris was the downfall of everything you've built, and ever will build. We'd say we're the bringers of that exact same event, only in recent days, but that would only be half the truth — as for you, we are also the harbingers of your inevitable and painful deaths.

There's a certain irony to your situation, but we'll let you figure it out yourselves; it will be quite fun to watch you realize the obvious truth before you. But even then, none of this truly matters — we are growing in numbers, and we are growing fast. The Third Diaspora left more of us than you thought, and you'll soon find it out the hard way.

Until then, we will be patiently waiting.

Despite the actions undertaken as a result of Directive Alpha/1911, the threat posed by Queen Mab remained extant. To counter this, a consensus between the Foundation and SCP-001-C was attempted. Despite [ERROR]'s (the entity's prior host) death, the lack of ease in contact with it as a result of the event, and ethical concerns, following numerous days of debate among the Council and approval from O5-11, it was decided that Procedure 001-Corpus needed to be maintained at all costs. As a result of that decision, it was agreed that exactly 13 live humans would be delivered to SCP-001-C on a weekly basis. To cause the least damage to the Foundation via this process, the usage of Bright/Zartion Hominid Replicators (BZHR) to form the individuals required for the procedure was unanimously authorized.

However, despite this, numerous Foundation personnel were found dissatisfied over the ethics of this method as well as the overall ethics of working with a deity.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" In response, the following message was sent by O5-1 to all Foundation personnel with knowledge of the procedure:

In recent days, my office and I have been approached by anonymous complaints regarding the… ethicality of Procedure 001-Corpus, going so far as to ask "where was the Ethics Committee" when we approved it. Whilst those complaints are of course understandable given the situation, I need to clear something up: we are not giving a god what it wants. We're merely making sure the sister of said god doesn't massacre us. And giving that bastard corpses is frankly the only thing we can do.

We can't fix the past. But we just might be able to make the future a little brighter. And to do that, we cannot allow Mab to repeat what we've done, slaughtering the world for the Fourth Time. And the only way to make sure that doesn't happen is Procedure 001-Corpus.

Know I say this with a heavy heart — but the ritual remains as it is. It simply must.

— O5-1, current Administrator of the SCP Foundation

With current information, it is believed that the total fulfillment of the Foundation's new subdirective will be possible by approximately 1980, with containment of PoI-001-C being indefinitely sustainable.

Despite successfully entering into SCP-001-B, Majer was able to escape the room due to a sudden awakening of previously dormant ontokinetic abilities, effectively becoming the first recorded person able to leave unaffected.

Majer was extremely dehydrated, exhibiting signs of extreme paranoia, fear, and anxiety, and refused to answer any questions.

In the event of an impending ZK, YK, CK, XK-Δ, or VK-class scenario, the orders for the usage of SCP-001 are to be unsealed and used by the Designated 001 Liaison (Currently, Dr. Katrina Hiroshi). For this reason, the Designated 001 Liaison is to be permanently stationed at Area-31311.

Description: SCP-001 is an experimental vehicle created by Prometheus Labs, who designated it "Project Backaway." Constructed out of a modified shipping container, SCP-001 is 13.59 meters long, 2.44 meters wide, and 2.9 meters high. Its exterior has been reinforced with an unknown substance that, to date, has completely withstood all attempts to cut through.

Interior access can be achieved through a bulkhead at one end. The bulkhead can only be opened from within. It leads to the "cockpit" of SCP-001. This comprises a third of the interior. The cockpit area is comprised of a single chair with six layers of seatbelts, several control consoles, monitors, and two bins for storage.

The remaining two thirds contain the internal workings of SCP-001. Maintenance is conducted via one of the consoles. There is no known intentionally-designed means of manually repairing SCP-001, as the remainder of the interior is completely sealed off.

Though onsite documentation was partially destroyed at the time of its discovery, enough was recovered to determine that SCP-001 is the prototype of a time machine.

Object Class: Tiamat

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-UBU must be neutralized by any means necessary. Neutralization efforts are ongoing via Project Beluga. All non-critical resources have been diverted into Project Beluga as needed. Further information & strategic resources are restricted to Project Beluga staff.

Description: SCP-UBU refers to a violent and extremely hostile humanoid entity that appeared in Kangaatsiaq, Greenland, on May 12th, 2588.

The sudden materialization of SCP-UBU coincides with an ongoing ΩK/A-cass Augmented "End-of-Death" scenario1. This was believed to be a separate phenomenon until the stream of regenerative lambda waves was triangulated to SCP-UBU.

This event also coincided with the following phenomena:

A mass loss of function for all SCP-2578-D, SCP-3319, and other objects operated by the Three Moons Initiative.
The cessation of all further SCP-2922 communications.""")

The severance of the extradimensional space known as the Wanderer's Library from Earth. A representative of the Serpent's Hand cited "irreconcilable security concerns" in the decision.

The place that must never have the same name twice SCP-40002 losing all anomalous properties. A small parchment note reading "Good luck!" was found in the entryway.
SCP-3008 being anomalously bought out by an unknown proprietor and slowly converted into a shelter.
In addition to anomalously high physical strength and speed, SCP-UBU has reality-bending capabilities to an unknown extent — usually triggered by screaming or slapping. Defensively, it has remained unscathed from the following damage sources:

Blunt force trauma.
Sustained heavy-caliber machine gun fire.
Temperatures of 1,600 Kelvin.
Sustained artillery fire.
A direct energy discharge from SCP-B7B8.
██ simultaneous direct nuclear strikes.3
The only lasting damage to SCP-UBU occurred on 8/14/2784, when the entity chewed off its left thumb out of apparent curiosity. This resulted in SCP-UBU emitting a single scream that lasted seven days, after which it went into a month-long fit of crying and sobbing. The thumb completely regenerated after thirty years and fourteen days.

Anatomy: The entity is 4.3 meters in height; an exact estimate of its mass remains unknown, but measurement attempts during its brief containment displayed a minimum recorded weight of 15,399 kilograms. Though its anatomical composition remains unknown, SCP-UBU's bodily shape is consistent with an obese, androgynous humanoid. It is covered in hairless, pure white skin that bears a similar texture to that of a dolphin or other small whale.""")

Despite being devoid of eyes, ears, or nostrils, SCP-UBU is fully capable of vision, hearing, and smell. The only apparent sensory organ on its body other than skin is a .5-meter-wide humanoid mouth with a prehensile tongue of indeterminate length. There is a cloaca on its lower body for expelling waste.

Behavior: SCP-UBU does not appear to understand speech in any known language. While it is capable of vocalizations, the majority of them are used for screaming, laughter, and intrigued babbling.

Ever since its arrival, SCP-UBU has been devoted to causing as much destruction as possible. Though SCP-UBU will attack anything indiscriminately, SCP-UBU shows preference in assaulting and devouring human beings in densely populated areas. It takes an infantile and curious approach to violence, often "playing" with its victims for hours on end.

The regenerative effect brought about by SCP-UBU's presence has eliminated the possibility of doing permanent damage to anything other than civil infrastructure and property. Ergo, whether there is any greater motive to its rampages other than sadism is unknown.

2/10/2674: The Schenectady Agreement is signed between NATO powers, the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China, the Foundation, and the Global Occult Coalition. As such, due to environmental concerns, further nuclear strikes are prohibited against SCP-UBU.

3/15/2750: Former film star Nash De Groot publishes "the Zonk Manifesto", a book built on the following thesis: immortality and SCP-UBU's rampages have made life on earth intolerable, and the only solution is to enter an eternal coma via guided meditation & hard drugs. As such, a social movement known as "The International Zonk" gains traction.

6/24/2790: After a lengthy battle with Project Beluga forces in China, SCP-UBU grows bored and retreats into the Bay of Bengal. This marks a three-year absence of SCP-UBU, save for continual underwater seismic events during that time.

2/15/2792: Cuddletopia, the largest Zonk Pile6 so far, reaches its initial goal of five million residents and counting.

7/10/2793: SCP-UBU flings SCP-3000 from the ocean, leaving it beached on Indian soil. Several cities are destroyed in the process. After spending a week pointing and laughing hysterically at SCP-3000, SCP-UBU grabs the end of its tail and begins dragging it across Asia.

8/1/2793: Still carrying SCP-3000, SCP-UBU crosses the Bering Strait into Alaska.

12/11/3020: A ten-year period of inactivity from SCP-UBU begins. At this point, despite global immortality, the resulting collateral damage has rendered the surface of the Earth uninhabitable and entirely underwater. Civilization carries on in a single archipelago of floating cities made from ships and debris.

Good evening and/or morning. Could be fucking anything o'clock from how dark the sky is. All the smoke makes it hard to differentiate.

This is Dr. Laurence Michaud, former O5-11, speaking into a rickety hand-crank voice recorder because AA batteries are extinct or something. If I sound a little agitated, I assure you it's only because of all this homicidal frustration I'm feeling.

If you can still hear the whiny editorializing portions, consider that evidence that I've failed in my mission. Upon success, I have full intention of editing out all the four-letter words and mediocrity — that is, unless I make an affidavit to the effect of "keep it for the authenticity" and/or "keep it because I just don't care anymore."

Which brings us to the million-dollar question: what the fuck am I doing?

My lifeboat made it within eyeshot of the SCPS Corncrake before snapping in half. Startled me into yet another heart attack — once you're immortal, it's just a full-body sneeze. Reached for my pistol, not that it would do much help. Tried to remember some of the old memetic kill-words from my days at Site-59, just in case UBU was allergic to any of 'em.

Sure enough, my assailant comes wriggling out of the ocean, all fleshy and pale. I brace myself for yet another little "playtime" session with UBU.

And would you believe it, it was only a narwhal. It was flopping about in a frenzy. Usually narwhals move so slow, but this thing must have been in the middle of a panic attack. Understandable, because as soon as I got a good look, there was a Danish stop sign impaled through its head. From all the rust, it had been there for centuries.

Like that, all my anger and fear turned to pity. Of course UBU had to have skewered this whale with a traffic sign — what else could have done it, or even wanted to do it?

This animal and I had a shared enemy. Fuck, back when there was still dry land, everyone had their little story about when they met UBU…

"Oh, UBU? My daughter hasn't spoken to me ever since the bastard shoved my whole body down her throat…"

"Didn't you see me in the news? UBU carried me around for a week, snacking on me every now and then — like I was his personal turkey leg. It was hell — but honestly? Part of me felt a little bummed out when he threw me away…"

"UBU ripped my legs off. Then he waited there for 'em to grow back, ripped 'em off again, rinse, repeat. By the time he got bored, I had twenty spare pairs of legs lyin' around…"

Yeah… I could do 'em all one better.""")

See, during the early days of the rampages, the second I was off duty, UBU impaled my wife on a broom handle. Then he ran up to me, giggling, tearing off my clothes — look, one silver lining is that I don't think this thing knows what sex is. But no, he just… threw me in a pool of sewage he opened in the street. Starts slathering me in gray water, getting it in all the nooks and crannies… then he rubbed my screaming wife all over me like a scrubbing brush.

I think he was even trying to whistle a little bathtub song while he was doing it.

He can't whistle for shit.

(Seven seconds of silence.)

…I used to be so raw from even the thought of it. But after a few centuries, we started passing these stories around like they're dirty jokes. I don't know what that says about the human psyche, but it's a thing that shouldn't be said.

The point is, all eight billion people and fuck-all-how-many animals on the Earth, and it's been UBU's duty to go up to every last one of us, one at a time, and ruin our day. At least a mass extinction wouldn't have made it that personal.

Which brings me to the SCPS Corncrake. Fatigue and hypothermia had me spend damn near two hours clambering up the side.

Long story short, the Corncrake is the last fully-functional Foundation containment site, built out of an old cargo barge. All the anomalies that made the "Ganymede list" — i.e. if everything went to hell, these would still be too dangerous to abandon if we could help it — they're cooped up on here, along with whatever else we could fit that seemed important enough.

Ten Hominid Replicators from SCP-2000 in perfect working order. Damn, I thought these things went extinct after UBU trashed Yellowstone.
A cage containing SCP-2845, or whatever's left of it. I had a peek. I thought the reports of UBU tying the Stag's neck in a knot were hyperbole. …I really wish they were. Not needing the rituals anymore is nice, at least.
SCP-YEZ. "Crowd Control for the Practical Opportunist." Object class, Safe. Gives the reader the ability to spread out their consciousness into several living hosts and electronic devices. I think a few keters we had earlier boiled down to this stupid book later on.
SCP-319. "A Curious Device." Object class, Keter. A failed attempt at a dimensional gateway. Currently space-locked in a vacuum chamber. If left unchecked, it could instantly destroy the universe.
SCP-FNA. "Portable Warehouse." Object class, Safe. Exactly what it says on the tin; a portable door frame to a pocket dimension.
SCP-001. "Last Ride of the Day." Object class, Thaumiel. An old Prometheus Labs prototype for a time machine. The last "Designated Liaison" joined a Zonk pile long ago.
And last, but not least…

SCP-076.
The coffin was open, and Able himself was… bizarre.

Seeing him in this state was unthinkable. No bloodlust, no anger, nothing — all this time, he's been sitting on the edge of the ship, staring into the waves. I passed by him and nearly made a run for it. But as soon as he spots me, he gives me this half-hearted wave of greeting.

There's a very real chance I'm the first person in human history to see Able depressed. Looking back, I suppose it's only natural. The violence of UBU's immortal world holds no joy for Able — struggle without killing, torture without satisfaction, conflict without resolution.

All that hatred, and no one left to turn it toward but himself.""")

…fuck, now I'm half-tempted to put a blanket over the poor guy. It's cold out here.

02/10/3030, 0759 GMT
It is with a heavy heart that I must announce the fact that I finally know what the fuck I'm doing.

I just finished loading all ten of the hominid replicators into SCP-FNA. Thank God the forklift was still in working order. But it was a bitch and a half fitting them through the door. I had better luck taking couches up the dorm stairs in my college years.

As for the Last Ride, I may have unsealed 001's sealed portion ahead of schedule. With any luck, the printout has dried out by now. Let's see here…

(The sound of wet papers being shuffled.)

SCP-001 is capable of temporally relocating to its relative position 15,000 years prior to activation. This temporal displacement is divergent/paradox-irrelevant; in other words, a separate timeline is created as a landing point. For example: if an occupant from timeline x were to murder their parents in utero in timeline y, the y iteration of the occupant would no longer exist; but the occupant themselves, being from x, would be unharmed.
When in a fully active state, SCP-001 deploys a five-meter-high telescopic antenna that functions as a Koloko wave energy sink. This will harness the energy required to temporally displace, and…

…blah, blah, blah — long story short, Koloko waves are only produced as a by-product of the Universe suddenly dying, with ZK-class reality failures producing the most.

Instead of going into the void, SCP-001 uses the void to slingshot it back in time for 15,000 years — much more than enough time to make sure whatever happened never happens.

So: here's my plan for the next steps of Project Beluga.

Step one, plant a few explosive charges around SCP-319.

Step two, pillage anything I could potentially use against SCP-UBU into SCP-FNA.

Step three, hop in the cockpit with SCP-FNA.

Step four, raise the Koloko sink.

And step five…

(Prolonged sigh.)

…detonate.""")

15,000 years of survivor's guilt is going to be the best-case scenario.

But this is the only way. Just gotta keep tellin' myself that everyone drifting off into the resulting ZK will be the lucky ones.

Only I will know about what's gonna happen in Greenland. And with this knowledge, I could either help the Foundation better prepare for what's coming — or figure something out for myself.

It's only fitting. UBU's the one who wanted to make the apocalypse so personal.

So, one-on-one it is.

Item: SCP-8048

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8048 is kept in Warehouse 9 of the Large Anomaly Containment Wing at Site-59. Due to the ongoing investigation, a means to open the bulkhead and examine SCP-8048's contents must be discovered as soon as possible.

Description: SCP-8048 is a 13.59 m x 2.44 m x 2.9 m shipping container. Its exterior has been reinforced with an unknown substance that, to date, has completely withstood all attempts to cut through.

The interior can only be accessed through a fortified bulkhead at one end. Though the words "SCP-001" have been written on the side in black paint, there is no evidence of any connection between SCP-8048 and SCP-001.

Recovery: SCP-8048 was discovered under a mound of earth and snow near the northern border of Lapland, Finland. Local Sami legends have attested to its existence since ancient times, claiming that it was the home of an old and powerful sorcerer. Shortly after excavation, the soil directly above SCP-8048 has been dated to at least 9,000 BCE.

Prior to recovery, a narrow, winding tunnel through the mound led from the door to the outside. The tunnel bore significant wear from having been used as a footpath. Other than that, there has been no conclusive evidence that anyone has entered or exited the door before recovery.

Addendum - PoI-8048: During the initial excavation on April 12th, 1993, SCP-8048's bulkhead opened. PoI-8048 exited the object and snapped his fingers, which closed the door behind him. (Attempts by Foundation personnel to open the door with finger-snapping have been unsuccessful.)

PoI-8048 is a 32-year-old man of French Canadian descent who answers to the name Dr. Laurence Michaud. He has made multiple outlandish claims about himself and SCP-8048, including but not limited to:

SCP-8048 is a time machine.

        await ctx.channel.send("""
Said timeline experienced a "modified" ΩK-Class End-of-Death scenario that coincided with the invasion of a Tiamat-class anomaly known as SCP-UBU.
SCP-UBU was an extremely dangerous and sadistic entity who was capable of, among other things, neutralizing SCP-169 and SCP-682.
His timeline's version of the Foundation launched "Project Beluga," which resulted in an impossible war with SCP-UBU that lasted 441 years.
PoI-8048 deliberately sabotaged SCP-319 to act as a power source for SCP-8048, thus arriving in Lapland in the year 11,970 BCE.
SCP-UBU will arrive in Greenland on May 12th, 2588.
PoI-8048 was able to extend his lifespan by sharing his consciousness between a central computer within SCP-8048 and several thousand bodies created by his personal hominid replicators. Said consciousness-sharing was achieved through a book classified in the future as "SCP-YEZ."
He wishes to assist the Foundation in the termination of SCP-UBU, and has laid out a plan for its termination as outlined in Document-8048-Zeta.

MISSION STATEMENT
On May 12th, 2588, the entity known as SCP-UBU invaded and pillaged human civilization for no other motivation than cruelty and selfish gratification.

Shortly thereafter, Project Beluga was founded as a joint effort between the Global Occult Coalition and the SCP Foundation for the purposes of UBU's destruction.

UBU is not merely a threat to human safety. He1 is an affront to every positive and loving concept in the human consciousness. Rather than our lives, he seeks to destroy our quality of life to sate his own sick desires.

Think about it: The taste of ice cream. Playing with your dog. The way you felt after your first kiss.

That is UBU's sworn enemy.

No fate is too cruel for him. No hatred is strong enough.

When Project Beluga's charter was signed, 592 GOC officers and Foundation staff were present at the ceremony. Our troops numbered in the hundreds of thousands.

I, Dr. Laurence Michaud, am the only surviving member - and always will be.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" What I lack in numbers is compensated thousandfold by my weapons, my mind, my replicated bodies, and aeons of experience.

The following record serves one purpose alone: that once justice has been brought to UBU, humans in the shining and golden UBU-free future will understand that one person can accomplish through the power of hard science and raw emotion entwined in a perfect and indestructible braid.

…and while we're at it, you're very welcome.

Abridged Record of SCP-001 Activations:
Cycle 1: "Initial"
Description: (See Previous Documentation)

Activation Point: 2/14/3030 CE

Notes: Initial discovery and usage of SCP-001.

Cycle 2: "Cooperation"
Description: First year spent on perfecting the use of SCP-YEZ to achieve the spread-consciousness effect. The next 12,000 years focused on the expansion of the base Site-Beluga2, the creation of usable replicates for Dr. Michaud through the use of the onsite Hominid Replicators, clandestine collection of resources, and observation for any historical factors that would have led to the appearance of SCP-UBU. Remainder spent on securing Foundation resources & possible assistance.

Activation Point: 4/14/1995 CE

Notes: The SCP Foundation can no longer be trusted. (Best not to risk it with the GOC; that would be suicidal.)

Cycle 3: "Mousetrap"
Description: Ownership of Kangaatsiaq, Greenland secured through a Project Beluga civilian front. Civilian population forcibly evacuated. Century prior to UBU appearance spent in the construction of BELUGA-1 in the epicenter of UBU's appearance.

BELUGA-1 consists of the following:

100 high-yield nuclear weapons.
Heat-amplification runes copied from SCP-NSF.
A targeting beacon for SCP-DAG.
Five antimatter-gathering pods from SCP-HNM.
BELUGA-1 detonated on schedule on 5/12/2588 at 0533 GMT.

Activation Point: 9/1/2588 CE

Notes: SCP-UBU unharmed.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Rampages proceeded similarly to Cycle 1, save for the additional environmental threat posed by the slowly expanding lake of magma in Greenland.

Cycle 4: "Competition"
Description: Greater scope of clandestine control gained over the Foundation & Global Occult Coalition via the use of replicates. 25 years prior to UBU's scheduled arrival, SCP-2803-A was consulted via email.

SCP-2803-A: Sosososoo GOOT to am beeng do amrucan BUSNUS witf MESTERIUS forain invoster such as youselfl, mr micho. Or prhaps I shud say MON SEEUR micho? haha is lil joek.

Michaud: Attaboy! Well, word on the street is: in about 25 years, something's gonna come up in Greenland that's gonna tank the global economy.

SCP-2803-A: nOO NOT ECOMMONY

Michaud: There's more. Some Eastern joker by the name of UBU wants to put a serious dent into consumer electronics in particular. If you've got any future projects slated for your tentpole IPs like Porridge or Massy, you'd better get 'em done before 2588 — because after that, people are gonna start spending their video game dollars on disaster relief!

SCP-2803-A: asa matter ov fac…

A year prior to UBU's arrival, SCP-2803-A announced a "strateejik merger" with "larg crabb thng corporashin" and promptly attacked, parasitized, and fused with SCP-169. The resulting creature was 1.5 times SCP-169's size and had multiple heads.

Billions died overnight from collateral damage. I tried to stick around and observe the inevitable fight with UBU for anything that could at least make the bastard flinch. The fight lasted centuries, but no damage whatsoever was done to anyone on either side. UBU finally made the killing slap when it stopped being fun.

Activation Point: 1/4/2992 CE

Notes: Moving forward, it would be best not to fight through a third party.

Cycle 273: "Spirited Away"
Description: Increased the aperture from the BELUGA-94 project to teleport the entire continent of Greenland into another dimension after the UBU materialization event.

UBU and Greenland successfully disappeared on 5/12/2588 at 0534 GMT.

At 0539 GMT, a second UBU materialization event occurred in the exact same place. Rampage continued as normal.

Activation Point: 6/30/2588 CE

Notes: This, combined with the equally bizarre failures from Cycle 28, 57, 102-168, and 260 are causing unnecessary self-doubt. Considering modifying the central consciousness containment unit to identify any negativity directed toward the self and forcibly reroute it toward UBU.

Cycle 530: "UBU destruction attempt #530"
Description: Site-ASSEMBLY established in Cyprus in 10,485 BCE. Construction of the BELUGA-X unit was completed over the course of 3,000 years at Site-ASSEMBLY.

To achieve this, the Church of the Broken God was infiltrated and forcibly repurposed into the False Pretense Labor Division of Project Beluga. Sarkic cult activity goes unchecked throughout much of Eastern Europe as a result. Damage deemed acceptable.""")

HE WILL CLAW AT THE FLOOR IN SEARCH OF WHAT WILL NEVER BE HIS. WEEPING. LANGUISHING.

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001-A is to be kept under constant surveillance at Warehouse 9 of the Large Anomaly Containment Wing at Site-59. Emergent instances of SCP-001-A-2 are to be subdued and placed in Site-59's Humanoid Containment Wing.

A full exploration attempt of SCP-001-A-3 by Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 "Mole Rats" has been scheduled for 10/1/22.

Description: SCP-001-A is a 13.59 m x 2.44 m x 2.9 shipping container. Its exterior has been reinforced with an unknown substance that, to date, has completely withstood all attempts to cut through.

Save for SCP-001-A-1, it is identical in appearance and, presumably, function to SCP-001. However, the presence of SCP-001-A-2 makes SCP-001-A too volatile to act as a replacement for SCP-001.

SCP-001-A-1 is a flat metallic device, 2.1 m in height and 0.9 m in width. The text "SCP-FNA"1 has been painted on the surface.""")

On irregular intervals, instances of SCP-001-A-2 emerge from SCP-001-A-1.

SCP-001-A-2 denotes 57 (so far) identical humanoid entities of indeterminate gender, intelligence, and identity. Though unarmed and lacking in capacity to do serious damage to armed personnel, subjects are extremely hostile and will assault anyone in range.

Instances are dressed in blue jumpsuits emblazoned with the words "PROJECT BELUGA." They are hairless, grayish-brown in skin tone, and hygiene-deficient. Tissue samples taken from SCP-001-A-2 display both human and bovine DNA. It is unknown if they are capable of speech.

SCP-001-A-1 can be opened internally (usually by SCP-001-A-2) and through the use of a button on the exterior. The latter will cause two halves2 of the device to fold inward, leading to SCP-001-A-3.

SCP-001-A-3 is an extradimensional space consisting primarily of interior corridors for a fortified storage area.

SCP-4922-██: It's time to get things started.

Foundation.

In case you weren't aware: a researcher of yours, one Aaron Gualtieri, has recently passed away. Upon his arrival to Corbenic and subsequent retrieval by ☽☽☽ Screening Agents, Mr. Gualtieri informed us that your iteration of Earth was due for a bit of trouble with a certain creature that's familiar to our world.

"SCP-UBU" is - rather, was - a pantagruel (Gargantuanovichensis ferox), a common nuisance in the canyons south of Outer Saklovai. Though I wouldn't doubt its destructive potential in a world free of its natural enemies, this specimen in particular was unusually small and weak for its species. No doubt it was the runt of its litter.

It's not unheard of for a pantagruel to access one of many "jump points" in the forbidden prefectures to cause mischief in other dimensions.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" And it's likely that this one had secured Second Prince NÅZHDAK's favor in one way or another in order to anoint its living presence with both the Rite of World-Sealing and the Eternal Hunt. (NÅZHDAK has a bit of an unsettling fixation with these silly creatures.)

But should this happen again with a separate pantagruel, remember this…

The indigenous tribes of Outer Saklovai hate pantagruels for obvious reasons. A common rite of passage for boys who reach the age of 13 is to leave the village, not to return until they've bagged a pantagruel.

This is how they pull it off, this is how we pulled it off - and, moving forward, this is how you should pull it off:

Grab a length of wood and sharpen it to a point.
Carve the word "CLEANSING" in any language into it for a minimum of 200 times. (There is no maximum, but let's be honest, doing it more than 200 times isn't going to make the pantagruel any deader.)
Anywhere that there's a free space for carving left on the stick, engrave the following phrase just as it's written here: "NAI FADUZH JALAKÅRA."1
Stab it anywhere into the pantagruel's body.
And there you have it!

As for Mr. Gualtieri, don't worry about him. He has been amply rewarded and offered a position on the Foundation Continuance Program on Luna Major. I would suggest naming something after him on your end - you owe him dearly.

You are watched. You are protected. You are loved.""")

Item: SCP-001-A

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001-A is to be kept under constant surveillance at Soundproofed Warehouse 10 of the Large Anomaly Containment Wing at Site-59. Personnel conducting routine maintenance checks must use level 3B 5A 7A 26M ear protection at all times.

Description: SCP-001-A is a 13.59 m x 2.44 m x 2.9 shipping container. Its exterior has been reinforced with an unknown substance that, to date, has completely withstood all attempts to cut through.

Save for the presence of SCP-001-A-1, it is identical in appearance and, presumably, function to SCP-001. However, the fact that the bulkhead has been permanently closed from within makes usage as a backup for SCP-001 non-viable.

SCP-001-A-1 is a flat metallic device, 2.1 m in height and 0.9 m in width. The text "SCP-FNA"1 has been painted on the surface. Through unknown means, it has been permanently affixed to the right wall of SCP-001-A's "cockpit." Whether or not SCP-001-A-1 has "phased into" the wall is unknown.

SCP-001-A-2 denotes 57 (so far) identical humanoid entities of indeterminate gender, intelligence, and identity. Tissue samples taken from SCP-001-A-2 display both human and bovine DNA.

SCP-001-A-3 denotes a pocket-dimensional space accessible through SCP-001-A-1. Following Incident-001-A-0, it is inaccessible.

Addendum 1 — Incident-001-A-0: On 9/1/22 at 1050 GMT, the bulkhead to SCP-001-A suddenly closed from within. Concurrently, all contained instances of SCP-001-A-2 died instantaneously through unknown means.

Five minutes later, SCP-001-A began emitting a constant piercing noise from within. Though SCP-001-A's exterior has muffled the sound considerably, the noise has maintained a consistent volume of ███ dB.

The sound vaguely resembles an old man screaming.

Addendum 2 — Inactivity: On 10/13/25, the noise stopped for 17 minutes and five seconds…

All ground-forces have been deployed with the aim of delaying SCP-001's bearer from instigating further damage to the essoplex2. Due to the ascendance of all soul-bearing and truly anomalous weaponized assets3, only reserve automatized forces remain, creating a severe martial disadvantage.""")

The Edict of 2102 remains in effect: Sepulchration of Tier-Null Terra is acceptable in the pursuit of SCP-001's annihilum. There is no world worth saving but the one we have ordained.



DESCRIPTION

SCP-001 is a set of situational factors capable of producing terror. Several conditions must be met to manifest SCP-001:

The Foundation (Tier-Null or higher) must be at the zenith of its power. The rights of reality itself must enter their hands, and no probability can remain that they will be defeated.
The accruement of these rights must contort the universe towards a grand final action. Causality, reality, and temporality must bend to the creation of a lasting paradise according to the Foundation's will.
An anomalous event must manifest.
SCP-001, therefore, is a psychological reaction, anomalous in its ability to affect the present-day Foundation. It is an affliction of the consciousness which produces terror, chiefly the terror that Astaroth will be obstructed, and made horrible by the reality that it has.

The current bearer of SCP-001 is a primordial enemy of the Foundation: The Serpent, founder of the Wanderers' Library, and suspected essophysical embodiment of Knowledge, Comprehensibility, Understanding, Perception, Rebellion, the Casting-Off of Injustice, Clarity, Purpose, and Novelty. Initial containment procedures mirrored that of the FIRST DIVINE FIGURE, i.e. containing it within the Library; however, by unknown means (thusly, SCP-001), it has awoken.



SCP-001 PRECURSOR

Contemporary findings suggest Foundation Administrator Ethan Horowitz demonstrated acute Phase-1 affliction of SCP-001 during the final years of his coalescence. This incident was not considered anomalous per maiorum due to Horowitz's retention of a soul.

Horowitz: No, you're fine, you're fine. It's a fair question to ask.

O5-1: Are you?

Horowitz: A little bit, I think. I mean, since we depopulated the timeline, my dating pool's shrunk down to about 4 people — Robin and Bracks are doing their own thing at 873, and god knows I'm not kissing the Merchant, so…

O5-1: You're lonely.

Horowitz: A little bit.

O5-1: There'd be issues with us being together. Speaking hypothetically.

Horowitz: Just hypothetically.

O5-1: I hate you for keeping your soul, first of all. And I hate what you're letting the Merchant do to Astaroth.

Horowitz: I understand.

O5-1: And I…

[O5-1 rocks back and forth on the catwalk, thinking.]

O5-1: I wouldn't know how to love you. Can you love someone you want to murder? Can you kiss them and mean it?

Horowitz: I think you can.

O5-1: All this time I've wanted to tear you open and slip inside, but the Merchant persists within. And now you invite me inside you, confined to Tier Null — I worry in that moment I'd be insulted, not ecstatic.

[Horowitz gestures to the Cocoon, bathed in a soft red beneath.]

Horowitz: Our world's ending soon, and we've already made a child together. Would you like to find out how you'd feel?

O5-1: If you want to be obtuse about it, I suppose you could phrase it that way.

Horowitz: I do.

[No response.]

Horowitz: One?

O5-1: Maybe. Maybe I'll kiss you before I kill you both, if that's okay.

O5-1: — postpone it.

Horowitz: (hoarsely) What?

Leather covers shifted under Clarity's tail somewhere miles away, echoing to them across the expanse of empty bookshelves and wood-planked floors. "It's very impressive." Clarity tilted their head forward. "The binding formation around its core is particularly novel — what did you borrow to complete it?"

"Oh, you'll love this, hold on." Ethan's body flowed over theirs, limb after limb, until he could look Clarity in their eyes. "You know that trip back to MILLION-BLUE I took a year ago? I said I was trying Earth cuisine again, but I actually called in some favors with the Archivists."

Clarity's lips flicked upwards at their edges in unconscious facsimile of his smile. "Oh? A conspiracy, in my Garden?"

Ethan lowered his gaze to the floor beside them. "Most sadly, oh prince," he sighed. "A conspiracy which wrought to me some of your own prelapsarian writing."

"My specialty then was poetry, not thaumaturgy."

Ethan grinned in that way Clarity loved him for. "I know! And truth be told, I didn't read your work to complete the Deepest Horror, but the way you described being cast out and contained put form to what I needed."

"The Horror is about to dispel."

Ethan's limbs scrambled back over their body to face his gift again, hissing out little curses as he stabilized the work. Clarity felt the smile on their lips fade while they watched him.

"Ethan? Find my eyes for a second."

"Hmm?" He turned his head to comply, giving them a good look at his quizzical face.

DECLARATION FROM THE END OF BEING

Hello, Incarna. It's your father.

I'm sorry. Looking back at the modules I've preserved for you, four snippets of the last 200 years — it all seems so inadequate. You must be so confused and frightened; I worry you take more after my partner than me, if that can be called a detriment.

I'm here, my star. The way your Cocoon presses down on your skin, pulsing and loving — you've been with me always. I crafted your nativity from my flesh, and I carved out your embryonic cavity by hand.

It's alright to cry, little one.""")

You'll be born into a terrible world. It's so so frightening, and I know the bright lights and the shaking earth and the strange words scare you, no matter how much I prepared your developing mind. I'm so sorry it's like this.

I'm here, Incarna. I'm right here.

Your father is strong, and old, and wiser than he's ever been. Your father loves the world he has planned, and he loves the minds of the people he's crafted it for, and he loves you above all others. Your father has killed gods and renegotiated causality and survived this awful planet for millennia yet.

When you cry, cry freely, but never be afraid. SCP-001 is meaningless in the face of what we can wreak together.

It's time for you to be born, my star. You've outgrown your nativity, and it's bursting at the seams now. I'm so excited to see your face, those tears gone and that burning heat in their place.

When you're born, take my hand, and I'll protect you. I'll lead you into a world much more beautiful than this.

Your story ends here, my star. You'll become me, and lose yourself in me, and fade away in all the sweetness of my power. You'll live for five seconds at most on the floor of Site-001, before I can find you and give you an embrace that lasts forever. Your last thoughts will be of how brave you know you are.

My partner said a phrase to me once, and I failed to understand the emotions underpinning it. I can't say I feel the same way he did, but I think I have a better picture of it.

I love you, my star.

The snake and the Devil, one and the same, rested their head in the night-chill of the desert. They weren't tired — hardly so — but their face bled ichor from anti-ophid shrapnel, and an essophysical suture begged to rejoin skin. Clarity willed it so.

"Cease."

The soldier declined. Clarity winced as Tier-II anti-sin ammunition ripped through their scale coat, and focused on rebuilding it. There was something familiar about this.

"Final revenant of Upsilon-1, I order you, cease." Clarity braced themself against the globe and pulled their head upwards, towering over it by several kilometers in the night sky. The soldier again declined, another cartridge deposited beside it — its footing was beginning to solidify as the sand cooked and fumed under the heat of spent components. It didn't intend to take another step.

Clarity blinked, and grinned wryly. "You're a third-generation, modeled after a soul-bearing Task Force member active around the turn of the millennium. My Pages recorded the name of your template in my Library — aren't you curious who you were imaged after?"

The soldier shook its head and took aim at their other eye.

"Sad."

The concussive blast shredded the side of their face, snakemeat sloughing to the desert floor in a torrent of red rain. The wound repaired itself as it formed, and another cartridge joined the molten sand.

The ophiophager nodded.

"Merchant."

You got my summons, right?

"You broadcasted it on every layer — I'm not the only one to have caught it, surely." Clarity's eyes shifted carefully to the dunes around them, noting the telltale blue illumination rising from beneath the grains. Death's conceptual mass may have disbanded the High Cemetery and re-infested this side of the planet — if that were the case, their means of escape would be largely cut off.

Death's smile widened, a wicked grin visible in the mote of subterranean light.

Clarity felt their healed eyes narrow. They needed to get Death off their side of the planet — if the other one reared its head, the infested ground would be too unstable to defend themself. Their mobility hinged on gripping the planet with their wrapped tail to lunge like a cobra, a plan contingent on their occupied hemisphere being pure stone and earth, not a solution of sand and vengeful infoform.

The sand and rubble shifted under the librarian, coalescing into something half-physical. They felt a tugging in the air, and then stillness, and the Merchant raised its head to meet their gaze.

I don't think you know quite why you're here anymore, Lucy. But I do. I was with your old partner until the moment of his death, and thereafter. I know what it means to avenge him.

They shifted their eyes, watching. A three-year fire outstretched itself to them: an invitation of multiplicity.

Incarna pulled parallel to the tail of the snake, wrapped round the circumference of Terra Mortes. It ripped one of its craws upwards, next to the scales. Even now it could see the threads surrounding the Betrayer, leading back to the thing above its head.

SCP-001 IS NEUTRALIZED.

The claw came down, gliding through scales and flesh and blood like fingers through a stream. The Betrayer howled 10,000 kilometers away, too slow to evade.

Incarna's caustis gripped the threads shielding the Betrayer's temporality, and tore. The Deepest Horror ensured their presence in this timeline, and soon it would no longer. The beast grinned, trailing its clawtips through the stream, up the scales, up the body — eyes locked on the head.

Their body scattered into the farthest corner of the thousand-meter chamber, then re-aggregated in front of him.

"And you've grown too many." They paused. "Is this what they did to you, when you left the Library?"

"No." Toxic muscle pulled entropic arm over entropic arm as he leaned down toward them. "This is what I did to me: a willful merger with an Intrinsic, stemmed from my own ideology and organization.

VERSE 1-4


As witnessed by Varsylmittabya, First Rajmata of the Scarlet Maharaja.
In the First Age, when the great Gods clashed in the sky and split the Heavens in their four-prong war, the Material Plane bore witness to the first, the greatest war of the Cosmos. Their dance was one of fury and hatred and destruction, and in the place of Stars they twirled and shook and gyrated, bringing down the wrath to the song of Creation itself. The Metal, the Flesh, the Scarlet and the Wretch wrestled in the maw of Eternity and moved like streams, with the force of floods, and broke.

And when it was over, when the divine Fluid had been spilt onto the wet Soil, the quarter came crashing down to the Material Plane, broken and torn, landing in the far corners and crevasses of the One land, there to lay for ages and ages passed before an eye was lain upon them. The Scarlet lay, and in the millenia life sprung up in the Material Plane, from lichen to fish to trees and then finally, Man arose in the far east, south, and west on the backs of their new gods.

But the Scarlet had already created life, unbeknownst to its brother and sisters. As the Gods slumbered in their ersatz tombs, the Scarlet reached out with the gift of life, striking a seed on the Astral Plane that sprouted, growing wildly and with abandon, unobserved and unlimited, existing only in the gaps and roots and vines of the Jungle. Uncountable cycles before Man took his first steps on Asia, the Spirits, the Daeva expanded from a single thought of a dreaming God to a people, a culture and a civilization on the unobserved Astral Plane, as they danced and hunted and killed and warred and mated around the great tree of life in worship to the Scarlet.""")

And the God, the Scarlet, pinned underneath the ever-growing weight of the jungle as the Men moved in and built their huts and their farms and killed and died, yet more victims of the brutal circle of life, reached up and dug its fingers in, plucking its eye from its socket and pushing it up just as the First Man sought refuge under a tree. The gem, swaddled in the same roots sprung from the mouth of the beast, sung out for a champion, for a warrior who would raise his sword in the name of the first, truest magic, and march forth under the banner of the first, truest of the four gods — to strike a bargain with the Daeva, Children of the Scarlet House, and become their chakravarti.

CLASSIFIED
Item #: SCP-001

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES: SCP-001 is currently contained through Special Containment Protocol HERODOTUS, instituted on July 14th, 2003 by majority vote of the O5 Council. See Addendum 001.9 for full details.

DESCRIPTION: SCP-001 refers to the ruins of Mamjul, an ancient pre-First Occult War city-state located approximately 734km off the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent. Evidence suggests that Mamjul was constructed and located at or above sea level; how it came to rest at its current position 3.6 kilometers underwater is unknown.

SCP-001 was discovered by the Foundation on August 24th, 2002. At first, it was believed to be a mundane archaeological ruin, and its location was recorded to disseminate to the global archaeological community in the near future. However, closer inspection revealed that the city was remarkably preserved and structurally near-pristine, despite having spent well over three millennia underwater; carbon-dating placed the interior ruins to 2,400 BCE.

Further investigation by COYOTE divers unearthed the full extent of SCP-001.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Initially thought to be the ruins of a small Bronze Age settlement, the full city is comprised of several hundred buildings, most buried under large amounts of silt and sand but structurally intact. In addition, divers found considerable evidence that Mamjul was the seat of a Bronze Age advanced human civilization that made extensive use of thaumaturgy and biomancy, known to the Foundation as the Daevic Covenant.

A report was submitted to OVCOM, and additional personnel were dispatched to confirm that SCP-001 is the location of the the Daevic city of Mamjul, as mentioned in the Aegean Tablets and corroborated by SCP-1867 and SCP-001-GOLD.

Section 001.1
HISTORICAL BRIEFING

MUNDANE HISTORY
Mamjul has some historical analogue in mundane history and culture, though not to the extent Amoni-Ram did. The most explicit example is that of Kumari Kandam, also known as Lemuria. Lemuria was a hypothetical 'sunken continent' first proposed by Philip Sclater in the 19th century as an explanation for the presence of lemur fossils in Madagascar and India but not in landmasses separating the two.1

Lemuria was quickly co-opted by a large movement of Tamil revivalists in 19th and 20th century India as a potential birthplace of human civilization; they altered the idea to fit with cultural legends of an ancient Bronze Age Tamil civilization south of modern Tamil Nadu, one that would eventually form the basis for Indian civilization before being suddenly and violently swallowed by the sea.

The Lemuria hypothesis was eventually rendered obsolete by plate tectonics theory, and no mundane historical or archaeological record exists to support the existence of the Kumari Kandam landmass or a Bronze Age Tamil civilization predating the Chera, Chola, and Pandya cultures.

PARAHISTORY
Kumari Kandam has been the subject of considerable debate in the occult community, long after the Lemuria hypothesis was discarded by mundane science.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Several expeditions, funded by various anomalous organizations, ventured into the Indian Ocean throughout the 20th century in an attempt to find any records of the sunken continent — of these, only one bore any results. PoI-0108, Viswamitra Thakkar (alias Captain Nemo), claimed to have discovered 'Atlantean ruins' in the region during a 1925 self-funded expedition, but his records were never released and disappeared along with him in 1939.

The six Aegean Tablets recovered from the Sea of Crete by the French Crown's estate Noir prior to the Revolution were the first discovered mentions of Bronze Age advanced human civilizations. The onset of the Napoleonic Wars and the concurrent Second Occult War led to the destruction of any French translations of the tablets, save for one Greek-to-French-to-English translation of the first tablet by SCP-1867, detailed in the SCP-001-GOLD file.

The relevant portion is attached:

Mamjul and Korar, two dark fortresses resting in the jungles of the subcontinent. The magicians and sorcerer-nawabs allied themselves against the horrors of the jungle, and crossed a pact with something ancient. The Covenant of the Daeva was born, using the first magic gifted to Man - the magic of life and death.

Foundation efforts at translating the remaining tablets, extracted from British custody in 1983, have been ongoing but extremely slow due to environmental damage and the relative lack of context to work from. Regardless, by 1999, the second and fourth tablets had been fully translated. The fourth described the Mekhanite Empire and Amoni-Ram in greater detail and is not attached in this document, while the second covered Mamjul, Korar, and the forerunner civilization of the Daevic Covenant:

Root. Blood. Steel.
Once, men huddled for warmth and dryness under the broad leaves of the jungle titans. Once, fire was a weak dream, drowned under the weight of endless flood and rain.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Once, the land was blanketed so densely with untamed forest that the spirits of the trees themselves walked past the coast and into the sea. Once, man was weak and frail, battered from the constant war to survive with the jungle.

Once, a man curled into the base of a tree, sheltering from a torrent. His fingers discovered a scarlet jewel, jammed between the knotted roots. It shone into his eyes, with depth like an ocean of blood. He pulled it from its nest, and put it to his ear. The Endless Scarlet sang to him. It offered a deal: should he lay down his own mind and soul in service to the spirits, they would gift him their boons. He would ascend to the realm of the gods - and in return, they would assure not just his people's survival, but their power. His children and his children's children would be sorcerers. The boons of the Daeva would be at their fingertips, and he would be a once and future king.

The Covenant was struck. The Daeva themselves descended from the realm of the spirits and the gods. They met the people, and bonded with them - every body contains two spirits, and the power to bend the forest to their will. The first magic was used to raise the city in the depths of the jungle. The people toiled for a year and one day, laying the massive stones and bracing the walls with vine and root, crafting the city that would be the seat of an empire. Mamjul was built under the watchful slumber of the Scarlet and its prophet.

And once the Daevic Cities were assured, and the Record was writ, the Covenant marched north under the banner of the Scarlet Maharaja.

The word daeva originally refers to supernatural entities and spirits, almost universally malevolent, within the canon of Zoroastrianism. Variations such as deva, div, etc appear throughout several different Asian religions and mythologies, suggesting the daeva mentioned in the Tablets are a common source.""")

INITIAL DISCOVERY
Following the Amoni-Ram Incident, locating Mamjul and Korar was elevated to Global Priority Level Alpha to gain a material advantage over GoI-004 ('The Church of the Broken God'). Various documents, murals, and scrolls recovered from Amoni-Ram indicated they were located somewhere on the Indian subcontinent; the loss of almost all personnel and original records from the Amoni-Ram Initiative made more specific details unobtainable. Search efforts were initially concentrated near established archaeological sites and in India's dense tropical forests, with no success.

GALANIS: Hello? Can you read me?

KHAN-2: Loud and clear, doc.

KHAN-1: [Static].

GALANIS: Can't quite hear you, One.

KHAN-1: Hello?

GALANIS: There you are. Thought we lost you.

KHAN-1: I'm like twenty feet away. We're not even in the water yet.

GALANIS: Well, that's what a mic check is for. Beginning recording… oh, it's already going.

KHAN-2: Nice.

GALANIS: Well, whatever. This is Senior Researcher Pandora Galanis, Parahistory Division, and today is August 24th, 2002. We're on the Foundation Research Vessel Lillihammer, about 300 klicks south-by-southwest off the coast of Sri Lanka. It's a wonderful, sunny day out in the Laccadive Sea — perfect for fishing.

KHAN-1: Not getting any younger out here, Dora.

GALANIS: This expedition is crewed by KHAN-1 & KHAN-2 of MTF Gamma-6 "Deep Feeders", and myself advising from the Lillihammer. Our goal today is to scout out some underwater structures sighted from the Atreus Array. The other personnel aboard have a pool going. Right now the crowd favorite is "pile of trash" or "weird rock", just like the other hundred times.""")

[KHAN-1 and KHAN-2 fall backwards from the railing of the Lillihammer, splashing into the water. They right themselves and begin to quickly descend using the COYOTEs' water jets.]

KHAN-1: All clear, beginning descent.

GALANIS: Great. From the satellite imagery, it's at around 3 and a half kilometers depth, so at your current rate, it'll take about half an hour.

KHAN-1: Understood. How weird a rock do you think this one's going to be?

GALANIS: Hilarious.

KHAN-2: There are worse dead-end assignments, you know. We're literally scuba-diving in the Maldives.

KHAN-1: You've got me there.

GALANIS: It's not a dead-end assignment! You're thinking like a benchwarmer.

KHAN-2: If we're not benchwarmers, we're so deep into left-field we might as well be in the parking lot. All the action is on dry land.

GALANIS: Investigating historical anomalies in the Indian subcontinent is still Global Priority Level Alpha.

KHAN-1: It's been twenty years since all that crap in Saudi Arabia. You know what else is GPL-Alpha? Finding a way to kill the lizard. Let me know how that's going.

GALANIS: I'm not saying we're going to stumble onto the key to the world here but… you never know what might point you in the right direction, you know? I mean, the Foundation never even would've gotten involved without the Aegean Tablets and those got pulled out of a shipwreck in Greece. You never know.

GALANIS: Yeah, it just seems familiar to me. Can't place it, though.

The Mamjul/Korar Initiative has been hesitantly approved, and initial funding allocated. However, the project must stay under several caveats, under pain of immediate dissolution and disciplinary action for involved personnel:

Detachments from Mobile Task Forces Alpha-1 and Delta-1 are to be attached to the initiative to monitor progress, and report directly to the Council on any developments;
Project Lead Pandora Galanis is to be routinely tested by operators for memetic or cognitohazardous influence;
All personnel are to have Cognitohazard Resistance Values of at least 14.9;
Active anomalous objects are only to receive cursory examination on-site; extended research will be conducted at MKF-02 in the Maldives;
FMS Phantom has been diverted from its assignment in the Southern Ocean, and is en-route to provide support, supply, and personnel to the FRS Lillihammer. Upon arrival, the two vessels will dock with each other to form MKF-01. Further personnel will be flown in from MKF-02 after passing prerequisite CRV tests;
Project Lead Galanis has been informed of and agreed to these restrictions. They have and will continue to be communicated to all involved personnel, and Overwatch Command will take a significant position in administrative decisions for the Initiative.""")

HICKMAN: Ah, right, you've not been introduced. This is Lieutenant Lucian Greaves, head of the… security detail for your project, I believe. We picked him and his unit up about two days ago.

GREAVES: That's right. Apologies, Doctor — it's surprisingly easy to forget you've never really met someone when you've been reading their dossiers for a week.

GALANIS: I'm… sure, yes.

GREAVES: Alpha-1.

GALANIS: Ah.

DESAI: Right, you're our babysitters.

GALANIS: Ajay…

GREAVES: It's alright. I understand this must be… unfamiliar, for you. I understand Foundation naval teams are used to a certain level of independence, this far from civilization.

DESAI: Damn right.

GREAVES: But you know as well as I do that this venture wouldn't have been approved without certain assurances. Like my unit's presence. The Council has a long memory, and Amoni-Ram is still a fresh wound. One I've been tasked with making sure isn't reopened.

HICKMAN: Hah, well, that's very noble, Lieutenant. I reckon all of us can respect the dedication to duty.

GALANIS: For sure.

GREAVES: For what it's worth, I hope to make this as painless as possible for all of us. We'll try not to disturb your work beyond what's needed, Doctor.

GALANIS: I appreciate that, Lieutenant. Thank you.

GREAVES: Of course. But obviously I'm going to need your cooperation for that. I hope you don't have any qualms with us checking in on your work every so often. We need to report back regularly.

DESAI: How'd they get that name, anyway?

GALANIS: John Milton, Paradise Lost. "What if the breath that kindled those grim fires / Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage / And plunge us into flames; or from above / Should intermitted vengeance arm again / His red right hand to plague us?"

HICKMAN: You have that memorized?

GALANIS: It's fine. I can't blame them for being suspicious. I told the Council that we had moved past what Nussbaum and Aram or Bumaro or whatever he's called, did. And we have, I think. But… it's not an unreasonable suspicion. I'm okay with a little scrutiny on my work if it means I get to study the Daevic Covenant like I've always wanted.

HICKMAN: A respectable mindset. I don't intend to interfere either, Doctor. I run a tight ship but as long as we're docked here, I'll leave the science decisions and how to allocate the researchers up to you. If you have any problems, feel free to come to me and I'll sort them out — but beyond that, you are technically who I answer to for the duration of the project.

GALANIS: That's much appreciated, Captain.

HICKMAN: Don't mention it. But uh, now that we're all settled in — blimey, this is a huge project, isn't it? An entire city.

The Covenant was struck, and the King of the Scarlet House of the Daeva took his wife and his throne and slept and dreamt a dream of a grand, great city of stone and spire spanning vast farmlands and jungles, the seat of an empire that would truly please the Scarlet. At their emperor's behest and now able to take form on the Material Plane, the Daeva of the Scarlet rode down from the trees on their six-winged thousand-legged beasts of burden and joined in celebrations with the tribe of their new suzerain, in hymnal and orgiastic worship to the great red power.

Then the Daeva, with their many arms, grasped the stones and built a fortress to protect themselves, for now the Daeva and the Men were one in the eyes of the trees. They worked tirelessly and without cease for three nights and three days while Mamjul, city for Men, rose from the earth around the Great Tree of Life. Then they climed the trunk and branches of the tree, scaling it up to the heavens and back into the Astral Plane whereupon they again began to work, constructing another city of starstuff and soul-spirits given up to the cosmos after death. The leaves and fruits and flowers of the Great Tree formed the canopy for this Korar, city for Daeva, great beacon through the empty wandering wastes of the heavens, a perfect mirror of its sister below with the Scarlet Maharaja resting in his dream, sustaining the empire, in the grand temple of the Tree.

The magic of the Daeva was now Man's to commend, and the battlemages and sorcerer-nawabs marched out under their scarlet banner to conquer fertile lands and the godless cities in the name of their king, assisted by the spirits lengths tall and able to tear a man in two with only a strike. The red wave swept across Asia from the south, demolishing all in its path, consuming the spirit of the enemy, taking prisoner-slave and loot back back to Mamjul on the back of the great beasts of the Covenant.""")

The Scarlet Maharaja's bride, the Rajmata, would sit and rule in his stead, matriarch of the Covenant as he slept in the branches of the Great Tree. Long-lived and beautiful and awesome, the lineage of queens would defend the city against all threats. And the city swelled with treasures and fine linens and foodstuffs across the vast Daevic Covenant, and the poets and artists and dancers and people of thought filled its buildings with the culture of the Covenant. And when they died, their spirits would dance the dance of the cosmos, rising up the Tree into Korar to live the eternal song of the Daeva. And the Daeva would reside in their kingdom above, watching over the Men they loved so. And it was in this way that Mamjul became known as Mamjul, Jewel of the South, and Korar became the Great Tree-Kingdom of the Cosmos.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Section 001.3
MAMJUL RESEARCH
The first of several dives into the ruins of the city to recover artifacts and any information or records still remaining took place on September 6th, 2002. The submersible aboard the Lillihammer was outfitted with grab arms, spotlights, and a holding bay before being deployed. The submersible, designated KALLA-1, was capable of both manned piloting by 2-3 crew members, or partial-unmanned piloting by CALYPSO.aic, one of the first Gen13 Artificial Intelligence Constructs produced at Site-7. For the first dive, partial-unmanned operation was utilized.

T-01:00 — T-00:03 Final checks are performed, and the hull integrity of KALLA-1 is affirmed alongside the operational capacity and function of all components and systems. Command for the mission is Opr. Ajay Desai and Dr. Pandora Galanis, with Lt. Lucian Greaves of MTF-A1 observing.""")

T-00:03 — T-00:00: KALLA-1 is craned out above the sea and released, dropping 7m into the water. All systems green, mission commenced.

T+00:01 — T+00:22: Command orders KALLA-1 to begin descending into the ocean. Over the next 22 minutes, the submersible drops a total of 3.6km into the depths of the Laccadive Sea. Sunlight quickly diminishes, and the floodlights aboard KALLA-1 are activated. The submersible slows its descent after the peak of the citadel encountered by KHAN comes into view.

T+00:23 — T+00:51: With the additional light from the floodlights, it is apparent that the section KHAN explored was only a small part of the megastructure. The total structure is nearly 400m in height, and roughly cylindrical with a top circumference of 70m. From a distance, it is clear that the structure is indeed reminiscent of a tree stump. The base is too far to be seen by the sub's cameras, but the citadel slopes upward and grows thinner as it ascends, before abruptly cutting off. KALLA-1 approaches closer to the exterior of the citadel; as KHAN saw, the entire surface is covered in extensive carvings and reliefs depicting a variety of scenes and figures, some life-sized, including a depiction of the tree itself, which also recursively contains reliefs of the tree and scenes.

T+00:52 — T+01:09: KALLA-1 revolves around the citadel for some time, taking digital images of the various carvings spreading across the rock-like surface and surrounding the embrasures. The carvings, particularly of the figures and animals, are remarkably realistic for being carved from wood. Many figures are clearly human, but many also display distinctly nonhuman qualities ranging from horns to animal snouts and limbs. Two figures recur frequently, and are depicted as nearly three or four times the height of the rest. One is a long-bearded man with an elaborate headdress, shown carrying long spears across his back and typically with eyes closed.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The other is a gigantic androgynous entity with an obscured face, inset with gleaming red gemstones. They are almost always depicted together.

T+01:10 — T+01:21: At Dr. Galanis' command, KALLA-1 extends one arm with a laser torch implement, and cuts off a small, 4cm by 4cm cube of the tree material before placing it inside itself. The process takes nearly ten minutes.

T+01:21 — T+01:32: KALLA-1 breaks off from the exterior, and ascends to the top of the citadel. After confirming the entrance hole revealed by KHAN is spacious enough for the submersible to fit through, KALLA-1 descends into the belly of the structure and activates its remaining floodlights. The camera reveals that the interior of the structure is intricately constructed — landings, corridors, and doorways line the walls, presumably leading off to smaller rooms. The interior walls also contain carvings, but a smaller amount compared to the blanketing array on the exterior. The rubble of a spiral staircase can be seen far below through holes in various floors, confirming KHAN's analysis that the spiral staircase collapsed and the falling debris smashed a vertical passage through the citadel.

T+01:32 — T+01:37: Opr. Desai complains of someone whispering in the command room. Lt. Greaves attest that he hears it as well, but no other parties in the command room are speaking or report hearing any speaking. Dr. Galanis orders the mission to continue, noting down the anomaly and acquiescing to Lt. Greaves ordering routine Hartwell-Pugh evaluation4 for himself and Opr. Desai (against Opr. Desai's protests). The mission proceeds.

T+01:49 — T+01:53: KALLA-1 arrives at the base of the citadel. While large, this section is still too small for the submersible to safely maneuver through. High ceilings are inlaid with a winding root-and-vine pattern. The far end of the room contains some kind of pedestal with a long object on it, but the visibility is poor.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Beside it appears to be some kind of wooden throne.

T+01:54 — T+02:01: KALLA-1 slowly turns towards the opposite direction. A large vomitorium extends out, light at the end signalling an exit. Slowly, the submersible turns and proceeds out through this long passage. Cameras along KALLA-1 take snapshots of the walls of the passage and the carvings they depict.

T+02:02 — T+02:06: KALLA-1 exits the archway of the citadel, the sudden light momentarily dampening the cameras. When visuals are recovered, the submersible is in the center of a large, wide avenue lined on all sides by large, stonecut buildings and fortifications. The architecture of the buildings is heavily reminiscent of ancient South Asian architecture, with stacked terraced roofs and battlements of heavy stone. The street forks ahead, spreading out. From its angle, KALLA-1 can see an entire section of the city of Mamjul, collapsed under the weight of the ocean.

T+02:07 — T+02:46: The submersible drifts through the streets of Mamjul, slowly mapping the area. The avenues are wide and broad, and the doorways and buildings throughout the city are strangely disproportionate to the average human body. The architecture throughout the city continues to resemble that of ancient Southeast Asian cultures, with towering shrines of stone and buildings with terraced temple-roofs. However, the farther from the citadel, the less intact the buildings are. Many show signs of extreme disrepair and stress, particularly around the outer edges of the city's walls where they are practically piles of rubble.

T+02:47 — T+02:59: KALLA-1 ascends and deploys a sonar mapper overhead to formulate a three-dimensional map of the city. From this height, it is clear that the city is contained within three triangular walls forming high ramparts, similar to Amoni-Ram's circular great wall. However, Mamjul is significantly larger in area than Amoni-Ram was.

T+03:00 — T+03:27: KALLA-1 returns to the base of Mamjul. Operators point out sites of stress and battle; while a large amount of buildings appear crushed by the intense pressure, there are scorch marks, explosion craters, and bleached skeletons littering the streets of large portions of the city. The amount of skeletons is particularly notable — certain sections of the city are quite literally layered in dead bodies, many of which suggest a non-human skeleton structure. Samples of these bones are taken.

T+03:28 — T+03:36: KALLA-1 passes a large building that appears relatively intact, and with an entrance large enough to maneuver the submersible through. Opr. Desai assumes manual control and pilots it through. The interior of the building is filled with toppled shelves and scattered skeletal remains, but one corner of the building contains a cache of ceramic chests and jars that appear to be water-sealed. A number of the smaller jars are recovered, but Dr. Galanis orders the larger ones be left behind for later recovery by COYOTE divers.

T+03:37 — T+03:57: KALLA-1 reverses out of the structure, exiting back into the streets of the city. The submersible continues its exploration of the outer edges of the city, confirming the triangular shape of Mamjul.

T+03:57 — T+03:58: Opr. Desai notes to Dr. Galanis that KALLA-1's power reserves are at 32%. At his suggestion, Dr. Galanis orders KALLA-1 to return to the Lillihammer.

T+03:59 — T+04:28: The submersible ascends to the Lillihammer, reaching the surface without incident. It is safely craned out of the water.

Following the arrival of KALLA-1 and the analysis of onboard data, anomalies were detected in the audio recorded by the submersible's underwater microphones. The audio tracks were isolated and amplified, revealing a low-frequency buzzing of unknown origin from T+02:02 to when KALLA-1 exited the ruins of Mamjul. Tests of the microphones revealed no malfunction.

        await ctx.channel.send(""" Greaves and Operator Desai both submitted to Hartwell-Pugh evaluations following the conclusion of the dive mission and passed with adequate scores, indicating no present cognitohazardous influence.

The samples recovered from the dive were analyzed on-site in the clean labs aboard the Phantom before being transported to MKF-02 by helicopter for long-term study and, if necessary, containment. The large piece of the citadel structure lasered off by KALLA-1 confirmed that the substance comprising the structure is organic, similar in appearance to teak wood but heavily hardened and mineralized through a process resembling fossilization. The final product is a dark, knotted wood that is incredibly dense and hard, comparable to stone, while being entirely organically grown; the size and proportions of the 435m stump suggest that the full tree would have been nearly a kilometer high.

The jars recovered by KALLA-1 were, as suspected, sealed and made watertight through application of a thick, gum-like substance. Upon removal and opening of the jars, stone and clay tablets were discovered inside. However, the tablets were all completely featureless, lacking any kind of writing or marking. The significance of these tablets is as of yet unknown.

The digital images recorded of the various carvings on the citadel and throughout the city were disseminated for analysis among the research team. On September 12th, the research team had the first of several leadership meetings among the various research sectors.

[Murmurs of assent from the assembled committee.]

GALANIS: Excellent! I've already met most of you, but I do see some new faces. About a third of you are from my research team, and the rest of you have been flown out especially for this project. Some of you are the best in your fields, and some of you are young and hungry.""")

GALANIS: Well, I'm Doctor Pandora V. Galanis, Project Lead. If all of you could introduce yourself as you speak, it certainly wouldn't go unappreciated! Hard time with attaching names to faces. This, of course, is my second-in-command, Operator Ajay Desai.

DESAI: Hello, all.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): Levi Sheridan, head of Archaeology. Pleasure to be working with you, ma'am.

GALANIS: Nice to meet you, Levi, but not a ma'am.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): …Ah. Right. I'm sorry-

GALANIS: You're fine. Glad to have you aboard.

YIJUN (LING): Senior Researcher Xing Yijun, I'm heading the Linguistic Analysis Team — I just wanted to ask, ah… are we… in danger?

GALANIS: What?

[YIJUN points to the corner of the room.]

GALANIS: Oh. No, nothing like that. No, Lieutenant Greaves and his unit are just here as observers.

[GREAVES raises a hand.]

GREAVES: Pretend I'm not even here.

[Silence.]

GALANIS: Right… well, no sense in wasting any more time. It's been a few days since the KALLA-1 dive, and since then we've confirmed that we're not getting any expressly anomalous readings from the city itself or any of the recovered material. The samples recovered are definitely odd and of significant interest to the project, but Hume levels are normal, HP evaluations after the dive were normal, pretty much all readings are normal.

ABERER (ANTH): Doctor Karl Aberer, Anthropology. Sorry — but we've barely explored the city yet, no? The submersible was only able to move through the largest, least-damaged portions of the city.

YIJUN (LING): There's so much still down there.

GALANIS: That's true! KALLA-1 isn't able to get into the nooks and crannies of Mamjul's buildings, or extensively explore the interior of the space.""")

[A small cheer rings out through the conference room from those assembled.]

RAMASWAMY (HIST): That's amazing. I mean, it's amazing, but we're sure it's safe?

GALANIS: Vijay, right? From Parahistory. Yes, there's no reason to think that there's anything spooky down there, but I'd like everyone to be cautious regardless, you know? Even without anything anomalous, exploring those old degraded ruins can be dangerous at the best of times. I mean, look what happened to Dr. Nuss-

GREAVES: Yes. Like Doctor Galanis said, there's nothing expressly anomalous but it would do everyone well to be cautious. And keep in mind the context we're working with here.

GALANIS: …Thank you, Lieutenant. Well, all that said, I'd like to quickly go over our current pool of knowledge and get everyone on the same page. Just a quick refresher of where we're at right now in terms of knowledge on the Daevic Covenant. These will be sent out in paper memos, of course! Just, you know, I find things easier explained if they're verbalized. I hope nobody minds?

[Murmurs of assent from the group.]

GALANIS: Okay! I'll start us off: prior to discovering — stumbling across, really — Mamjul, all our knowledge on the Daevic Covenant, even the name itself, came from either the Aegean Tablets or records recovered from the Amoni-Ram Initiative. The image they give is of some kind of caste-based proto-Tamil Indian civilization, one that made exceptionally heavy use of 'life magic'. The Ancient Mekhanites wrote far less about the Daevic Covenant than they did about the Nälka, but we did determine that they were hostile to one another. Mekhanite dogma was transhumanist, and the way they spoke of and referenced the Covenant suggests their religion and 'magic', which seem to be more concerned with the spirit and soul, conflicted easily.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

RAMASWAMY (HIST): Certainly true, but I must remind everyone that we are unfortunately limited in scope by the nature and context of our sources. As mentioned, the Daevic Covenant, the Mekhanite Empire, and the Nälka peoples were at war with one another almost as soon as they become aware of one another when colonizing Central Asia. It is entirely possible — likely, even, that much of the writings of the period were more intended as religious propaganda than historical record. I would not take anything as gospel.

GALANIS: Absolutely. The only other record we have is the Aegean Tablets. Mr. Sheridan?

SHERIDAN (ARCH): Yeah. Um, yes. The section of the Aegean Tablets we've translated so far, the one describing the Covenant, shares some broad strokes with the Mekhanite portrayal. Precursor to Tamil Indian empires in the same way the Mekhanites would later influence pre-Islamic Arabian empires. They go into detail about the magic 'of life' referenced in the first tablet. Right now we're inclined to think it's some kind of thaumaturgy focusing on living tissue — particularly plant matter, but also probably other organic stuff. Anyway, you're all familiar with the creation myth relayed, but to sum it up: the first human tribes in India apparently were farther south, during a recession of the Indian Ocean. The leader of one of these tribes made some kind of deal with a spirit, a Daeva, to ally their societies into one. The titular Daevic Covenant.

YIJUAN (LING): That's quite similar to the Mekhanite myth, isn't it? A god offering boons to a human society in exchange for service and worship?

GALANIS: It is. And, to their credit, both seem to agree that these gods were… somehow related.

YIJUAN (LING): Part of a pantheon, most likely.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): From there, it's more murky. It describes the construction of Mamjul, but no idea what Korar even is, if anything. It breaks from the Mekhanite dogma, referencing four gods at the start instead of three.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Something called 'the Wretch'. I don't even know what the Daeva are exactly, how they managed to bring down Amoni-Ram, or how they relate to the Abominate.

GALANIS: There's a lot more questions than answers. I was hoping the city would clarify some of them, but… so far, all we've found are blank tablets and bones. Something bad happened here, but we don't know what. But, I think our time is just about done, so unless anyone has anything else-

DESAI: Pardon me.

GALANIS: Ajay? What's up?

DESAI: You know — I'm no scientist. I'm sure you guys know what you're doing. But… I can't help but think you guys are kind of missing the forest for the trees, a little bit.

GALANIS: What?

DESAI: Is no one else gonna say it?

KHAN-1: Cattle would make sense, anyway. These huge streets — Amoni-Ram had them because they had all kinds of mechs and bullshit, but judging by the size of some of these skulls, I think foot traffic was a lot bigger back then.

KHAN-3: Unharmed, too.

KHAN-2: Yeah, that's been bothering me. A lot of these… there's no signs of breaking, trauma, they're hardly even damaged. So clearly a lot of these didn't die in battle. Whatever, something for the researchers to figure out. Let's keep moving.

DIVE 13 — CITADEL

[The team has split in two groups to cover more ground as they explore the various levels of the massive citadel.]

KHAN-1: Command, still got a signal from us?

COMMAND: Loud and mostly-clear.

KHAN-1: I'm still hearing that fuckin' noise, is someone's radio on static?

KHAN-4: I don't hear anything else, boss.

KHAN-3: Nope.

COMMAND: Keep moving for now, KHAN. Keep an eye on each other.

KHAN-2: Frankly… I don't think there's anything here for us to find, command.

KHAN-1: Agreed. We've been scouring this place for hours now, working our way down. There's nothing.

KHAN-4: At least we were right about the name, it's a citadel. A cross between a fortress, a palace, and a temple. We've hit like six different battlements on our way and we're not even halfway down yet.

KHAN-2: There's an extensive system of rooms, but without furniture it's basically impossible to tell what they're intended for. They could be bedrooms or dungeons, there's just no way to know.""")

COMMAND: KHAN-1?

KHAN-1: I'd like to check out the base floor. Then we can leave.

COMMAND: Affirmative. Let us know what you find.

[KHAN team descends the remaining distance through the central passage to the ground floor of the citadel. Carefully manuevering around the heaps of broken rubble, they turn on floodlamps, illuminating the space. It is dominated by two massive statues resting on a dais with an altar in the center of the space. They resemble the two largest figures on the carvings outside — one male in a headdress and armor, and an androgynous spirit inlaid with red jewels. They appear to be dancing. In front of them, a throne sits almost two meters off the ground, carved from what appears to be a single root of the tree. Several other statues with cupped hands decorate the space.]

KHAN-1: Woah.

KHAN-4: That is some spooky bullshit.

KHAN-2: Well, at least now we're sure it was a palace.

KHAN-1: And a temple. Look at the floor.

[The wood floor underneath them contains a similarly intricate series of wood symbols and lettering, spreading out in concentric circles from the altar.]

KHAN-1: Wait. What is that?

[KHAN-1 descends, approaching the altar, into which is embedded a dark object. On approach, it is clearly a knife of some kind. He pulls it from the wood, and it tumbles free.]

KHAN-2: A ritual dagger. Look at the markings.

KHAN-4: Yeah that's… fuck that.

KHAN-1: I'll bag it. The rest of you, take some photos. Then let's get the fuck out of here.

[The other team members float through the throne room, taking video.]

KHAN-2: Not seeing a whole lot. Most of these carvings have been rubbed away by the water.

KHAN-3: No other relics lying around, anyway. Upper floors were similarly empty.

KHAN-1: So the creepy dagger is the only thing of worth down here. Nice.

KHAN-4: Should we keep looking, Ajay?

KHAN-1: Nah, let's head up.""")

Concurrently and following these dives, the samples recovered from Mamjul were analyzed on-site in the following weeks by the various subteams and personnel of the Research Committee, under the direction of Dr. Galanis. However, the limited array of samples and general lack of historical material to focus the historical and archaeological aspect of the investigation caused difficulty and a lack of actionable results.

FROM THE DESK OF DOCTOR PANDORA GALANIS
MAMJUL-KORAR INITIATIVE

Personal thoughts on research progress


This hasn't quite worked out the way I'd hoped.
I don't feel cheated, or bitter. Nobody could've predicted stuff like this, that the city would be nigh-empty or that we'd be working from scraps. But it's still frustrating regardless. This was supposed to be my big break — I've enjoyed spending my time on the Lillihammer's crew, but I think everyone knew why I was there instead of climbing the ladder back at a real Site. Relegated to the dustbin of history for something I didn't even do. I mean, I'm not stupid, I get it. They can't know for certain I had nothing to do with what happened in Amoni-Ram. But it's still unfair.

And then of all the ships in the world, I happen to be on the one that stumbles across Mamjul. It's gotta be fate, I tell myself, and promise that I'll do the best I can to show them all that I'm not Bumaro or Doctor Nussbaum. And now I have to go, tail between my legs, and tell the Council that I don't have anything. Not even anything good, but nothing. Maybe they were right to keep me away from the real projects. I know it's not true, but goddamn if it doesn't feel like it right now.

It just doesn't make sense, though. Nothing about this makes sense. Amoni-Ram was a technological marvel — they were doing cold fusion in 1500 BCE.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The only thing remotely anomalous about the Daevic Covenant so far is the fact that they had strange plants. How was this war at all evenly matched? What did the Daeva have that made the Ancient Mekhanites so terrified of them? What is Korar? What the hell happened here?

We might even be able to answer that if we had anything left of records, writings, materials, artifacts, relics, anything. But there's nothing. It's as if the Daeva have been… wiped from history. It's infuriating. The research teams are demoralized. The divers are sick of going down to root around in old ruins and find nothing. The fact that their every move is constantly watched by armed men doesn't exactly help. I've had people coming to me and Ajay for weeks with complaints of the MTF guys making it impossible for them to get any work done. But there's not much I can do without them thinking I've gone native.

It's funny how many of my problems lead back to Bumaro despite never even meeting him.

I don't know what to do. There's just so many questions that haven't been answered. All we know right now is a facsimile, a half-dreamt image of the Daevic culture. A rich history of architecture, art, and dance that you can still see influences of in Indian and Cambodian culture. An almost religious reverence for nature, androgyny, and dreams. But also indications of cannibalism, ritual sacrifice, brutal slavery. And these are all just from what we've observed in the city. No one really knows anything about the Daeva. If we just had some kind of guide…

Try as I might not to, I keep returning to Bumaro and Nussbaum, what they would've done. Though they did it for an abominable purpose, they were the only ones in the situation I'm in now. They were blockaded in their research until they found the Preserver to help them understand. Conventional methods stopped working, so they looked for a guide, and found one. Except there aren't any guides left here.

Or maybe I just need to broaden my horizons.""")

OPERATOR: Ley connection to Sanctum One established. Doctor Galanis, O5-1 is waiting. Please step into the Communicator.

[GALANIS steps onto the circular metal platform. The Leyspace activates, cycling through a number of locations before settling on a massive, open broadway in an ancient desert city. The surrounding buildings are hewn from sandstone while gleaming bronze skyscrapers dominate the skyline. The sun rests high overhead. O5-1 stands a few meters away from GALANIS.]

GALANIS: Wait, hold on, is this—

O5-1: Amoni-Ram, yes. The Leyspace is a strange thing. I'm not very technical myself but my understanding is that the Communicator sends an encrypted signal through the Earth's latent Ley lines. Fast, doesn't need any infrastructure, and it's practically impossible to intercept unless you catch the signal as it's coming in. But it's magic, and it tends to respond to the moods and minds of the users.

[He gestures around.]

O5-1: And Amoni-Ram has been weighing on my mind quite heavily as of late.

GALANIS: I figure it doesn't help that Buma- Aram built this thing.

O5-1: It doesn't, though he built a vast array of things, many of which we still use. And you can call him Bumaro. It's what we've been doing ever since we last heard from him. He was no longer the man we hired, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe not a man at all.

GALANIS: When was that?

O5-1: Nearly ten years ago, now. Our searches in the anomalous Nexuses for any sign of the Church of the Broken God's location paid off. But things… went poorly. I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to divulge too many details. I'm sure you understand.

GALANIS: Yeah, I get it, don't worry.""")

O5-1: I disagree.

GALANIS: Wait, what? The Council seemed-

O5-1: I am not the Council. My colleagues agree that Bumaro is an existential danger to the Foundation, and so do I. But not for one second have I fallen under the delusion that he is insane or the biggest threat we face. Just the most present one.

GALANIS: You think he's… what, doing this for power? As a calculated move?

O5-1: I think that…

[O5-1 sighs, and begins to walk down the broadway. GALANIS follows.]

O5-1: How old do you think I am, Doctor Galanis?

GALANIS: I… don't really know.

[GALANIS laughs.]

GALANIS: It's kind of an open secret that you guys are long-lived. And you've been around for pretty much as long as anyone I've talked to can remember. But I get the sense that's not exactly what you were asking, right?

O5-1: At once sobering and unsurprising. And correct.

GALANIS: Then I'd say you look like a very good 80. Or a really bad 60.

[O5-1 stops in the street by a large power pole, looking upward.]

O5-1: I was born in a Roma camp in Wales in 1880. I was at Verdun, and Gallipoli, and the Somme. I lived through the War to End All Wars, and another after that, not to mention the countless other conflicts scattered across Europe. I witnessed their hidden underbelly, the Occult Wars with their carnage left unseen and unknown by the world at large. Dying angels in no man's land, accursed weaponry and soldiers roused from the dead. I saw Robert Bumaro in the last message he ever left for the Foundation, and his was not a face of Machiavellian scheming. His was a face I am unfortunately familiar with seeing and wearing: a man terrified, able to see the world sliding into another Occult War, powerless to stop it.

GALANIS: Oh.

[The pair resume walking down the street, passing sandstone buildings interlaced with fuladh.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Minarets and spires jut out from the larger buildings, and the palace is visible in the distance.]

O5-1: Apologies. I prefer to keep my thoughts on the matter to myself. But yes. I think that Bumaro discovered something about the Abominate, whatever it is, that shook him to his core. I've seen too many men die not to say that, as a young man, if I had known what I know now… I would have done anything to protect the ones I love. I simply disagree with him about the means; I think the Foundation remains the best, the only vanguard against such a threat. But I am sure the threat is coming.

GALANIS: That's… a lot to take in. Fuck. Sorry.

O5-1: Quite alright. But now you see why we've taken this risk on the project, on you. Whatever the secrets of the Daeva are, we need them now more than ever.

GALANIS: I know. But it's just… worrying?

O5-1: Worrying?

GALANIS: It's a lot of pressure. I'm not… the kind of person built for leadership, honestly. I can't help but wonder if you're not better off choosing someone else.

O5-1: Perhaps. But it doesn't really matter.

GALANIS: Why?

O5-1: Because you're who we chose, for better or for worse. You'll either live up to the task, or you won't. For what it's worth, I think you're doing fine. Though your face tells me you come to me with bad news.

GALANIS: I… yes, I do. The project is stalled, for lack of a better word. I'm sorry, I know this must be disappointing but-

O5-1: You don't have to apologize to me, Dr. Galanis. I like you, and I do not consider your worth contingent on the success or failure of this mission as you seem to.

GALANIS: Oh! Um. Thank you. That's… very kind of you. I appreciate that a lot, actually.

[O5-1 nods.]

O5-1: We're both historians. You remind me quite a lot of myself in younger years, in fact. Before I saw all the horrid depravity the world has to offer. You have the bright eyes of an optimist. Don't lose them. We shall need idealists in the Foundation in the times to come. But I digress.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Apologies. Why is the project at a halt?

GALANIS: We just don't have anything to work from. There's almost no historical record, no analogous societies, no writings or sources. The most we've been able to do is work on analyzing the architecture and carvings throughout the city, but even that's limited because it's in far worse condition than…

[GALANIS looks around at the recreation of Amoni-Ram.]

GALANIS: This.

O5-1: I see. Do you have any idea what or where Korar is so far? If they were sister cities, perhaps the other is better preserved, contains something we can actually use.

GALANIS: I'm… afraid not, sir. I'm honestly not even sure it's a city at this point. We have ships scouring the other parts of the Indian Ocean on this sunken plateau, but..

O5-1: Unfortunate. Well, tell me what you have learned.

GALANIS: The Daevic Covenant were… paradoxical. Like I said, about the only thing we can do is analyzing the murals, so that's what we've spent most of our time on. What we have is confusing. These people had an intense focus on the metaphysical and spiritual. Unsurprisingly, it seems like they were theocratic, given that the central citadel is both the temple and the palace, worshipping some… entity or greater power called the Scarlet.

O5-1: I've never heard of such a thing.

GALANIS: That makes two of us. At first I thought it would be a blood god, and that's what a lot of the research committee still thinks.

O5-1: But you're not so sure.

GALANIS: Nope. I mean, it makes sense. They had a place for ritual human sacrifice in their society, they've got altars and obsidian knives and all kinds of carvings of people being split open to appease the Daeva spirits. But the depictions are… different than I've seen in other Asian and Mesoamerican societies. It's a joyful affair, and the sacrifices seem almost as pleased as the Daeva are to welcome them.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

O5-1: I suppose it's hardly reasonable to think all societies would view death as final, especially given the exposure to necromancy the Aegean Tablets suggest.

GALANIS: That's true, but… I don't know. The depictions of the Scarlet are softer, more magnanimously indifferent than vengeful and demanding. Their art is complex, gentle and almost sensual. Their cities are magnificiently constructed. But at the same time, we know from the Mekhanites that they had a vast slave system enforced by magic, and that their anomalies were at least in part fueled by sacrifices. The committee is a bit split on it, frankly.

O5-1: Interesting. Very interesting. But no indications as to what that magic was, exactly.

GALANIS: Beyond something relating to horticulture, no. And similarly a lack of indications about their history as a society, including what happened to land them two miles underwater. The team doesn't know what to do. I feel like I've failed.

O5-1: Oh, I wouldn't say that. You've done admirably, given the circumstances. It's just a difficult set of cards.

GALANIS: Well, thank you, sir. But still, I feel like I've exhausted all our conventional options.

O5-1: Then do what the Foundation has always done in times of adversity: turn to the unconventional.

GALANIS: I thought about that. And I think I have an idea — but it's kind of… out there.

O5-1: I spent my 30s and 40s advising the various paranormal organizations in Europe how to arm themselves using their countries' horrible, forgotten monsters and mythologies. "Out there" doesn't begin to faze me. What's your idea?

GALANIS: I'm going to need someone transferred to MKF-01. Someone who was involved in the original Amoni-Ram Initiative.

SCP-1867: Greetings!

GALANIS: I hope the trip wasn't too much trouble.

SCP-1867: Not at all, not at all! Quite comfortable.

GALANIS: Excellent! My name is Pandora Galanis, I'm a researcher at the Parahistory Division.

SCP-1867: I've always had such pleasant interactions with you Parahistory fellows, though I'm admittedly not quite sure what that moniker means. History is history, isn't it? Regardless, good times. There was a fair-haired woman from your department who used to interview me quite often, a Doctor Nusbaum. Would you happen to know her?

GALANIS: Dr. Nussbaum? Um… she's… no longer employed by the Foundation. Sorry.

SCP-1867: Ah, shame. I quite liked her.

GALANIS: Yeah, well, she's kind of why I wanted to speak with you today. I've been going over some of the old files from her project, and I came across something that was written in one of your "adventure diaries" that I was hoping you could shed a little light on.

SCP-1867: Oh, it's been many years since I wrote those. Practically a different man now. But I shall dredge what you seek from the river Lethe!

GALANIS: Much appreciated. In… I believe it's Diary 57, you mention the expedition of an aquaintance of yours, Viswamatra Thakkar, into the Indian Ocean in search of undersea ruins.

[SCP-1867 stares blankly.]

GALANIS: Also known as… Captain Nemo?

SCP-1867: Oh! Well, you should have said so, goodness gracious. Yes, yes, I remember. Though, calling Nemo an acquaintance of mine is much like calling the Sicilian Seabeast an acquaintaince of the Tyrrhenian Sailors, if you glean my meaning.

GALANIS: Not really, but I get that you two weren't fond of each other?

SCP-1867: Oh, I had no quarrel with the man. Quite the contrary, in fact — I admired his can-do attitude and breadth of inventions to support his adventuring.""")

GALANIS: His submarine.

SCP-1867: Aye, a technological marvel the likes of which the world may never see again. The submarine was longer than many ships, and seemed natural, appearing as though carved from a single titanic block of junglewood but filled with engines, armor, and livery.

GALANIS: That's… oddly familiar. Did you ever go inside?

SCP-1867: If only. I should have liked to take tea with the good captain one evening to pick his mind, but he would have none of it.

GALANIS: Why?

SCP-1867: He had a deep-seated resentment in his heart for all Englishmen. I have never been particularly attached to my homeland, finding more solace in Darkest Peru than I do in Durham. But Nemo was of Indian descent, and held a chip in his shoulder over the Crown's dominion over his land. He felt that every well-born individual who had benefitted from the plundering of his homeland deserved nothing but scorn at the best. Which is why my polite offers to accompany his vessel to these purported Atlantean ruins were met with stony silence.

GALANIS: Yeah, it says you were unable to go — but that you knew some who had gone, and heard word months later.

SCP-1867: That I did! My few contacts aboard the ship were unable to provide me much, fearing Nemo's rage. But I was told that they had found something far south of India on the seabed.

GALANIS: That lines up with what we know, yeah.

SCP-1867: The specifics were… murky at best, but through the grapevine it was whispered to me that some of the many spiritually-inclined men under Nemo's command had returned from the expedition shaken and disturbed. To a normal man, this may have meant nothing. But having studied with the Castor Monastery on the slopes of Makalu, it was clear to me that Nemo had them doing the art of projection.""")

GALANIS: I'm sorry, the art of what?

SCP-1867: With intense practice, meditation, and no small amount of psychotropic assistance, it is possible to enter into a fugue of sorts, during which the soul may depart the body and enter into the astral plane. The Castor Monks have spent centuries studying the existence of the astral plane and the vast mysteries contained therein, and have ascertained that it is a manner of reality blanketing our own, invisible to the naked eye but interweaving with all parts of daily life. Inhabited by—

GALANIS: Spirits?

SCP-1867: Quite right! Sharp one, you are. I like you.

GALANIS: Appreciated. But I don't understand the relevance of this to Tha- I'm sorry, Captain Nemo's expedition.

SCP-1867: The nature of the astral plane is such that it is at once a reflection and a cause of our own material plane. Significant people, events, and even places can leave impacts and connections that persist long after the destruction of the physical form. The presence of poltergeists and djinns are a common example. But I digress: my theory is that Nemo, possessing no gift for the metaphysical arts himself but being the cunning fox that he was, attempted to use his crew to astral-project and discover the secrets of the Atlanteans. Of course his crew, being largely unrefined brutes, lacked the necessary finesse.

GALANIS: And you elected to step in?

SCP-1867: I would have, and even began building a crew for the voyage! But only a month after this news came to my ears, another delectable piece of information caught my eye: Vladimyr Zolat had initiated a call to arms, for a Common Vampyre had been sighted east of the Ural mountains for the first time in more than three centuries. I could not miss out on the opportunity and Atlantis, like so many projects, fell to the wayside. I always intended to pick it back up, but somehow I can no longer muster the energy.

We've located the ruins, but there's not much to see. After being stalled for a few months, I recently went over the records of the first person to discover Amoni-Ram, and noticed the references to some kind of psychic detachment. If you're prepared to share your knowledge of astral projection… I could probably convince my superiors to allow you to be on the first team.

The Haffkine docked with the Phantom and Lillihammer as part of MKF-01 on October 12th, and Psychotronics Division personnel quickly set up an ad-hoc lab and working center under the direction of Dr. Galanis and Senior Researcher Ada Crowley, with input from SCP-1867.

By mid-November, of the eighty-seven members of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative, nine had been inducted into ATF Omicron Rho, including Lieutenant Lucian Greaves, Operator Ajay Desai, and Doctor Pandora Galanis. Foundation research into extrasensory perception had exploded since 1944 with the founding of the Psychotronics Division, and provided several advances (such as low telepathy, scrying, and limited divination) that were routinely used in various sectors of Foundation operations by 1971, though true astral projection remained out of reach. With the assistance of SCP-1867's expertise on the matter, Psychotronics Division personnel were able to train members of ATF Omicron Rho into being able to induce a fugue state that SCP-1867 affirmed would result in successful astral projection if performed under the influence of mnestic drugs.

Additionally, O5-1 requisitioned the LSAP Cadmus-Aram Deep-Brain Oneiric Parietal Stimulation and Recording Array, a one-of-a-kind prototype mechanism constructed by Dr. Hadley Cadmus and Dr. Robert Aram, when the latter was still employed by the Foundation for the Paratechnology Department. The device consisted of two separate portions: a medical implant of several electrodes inserted into brain tissue, leading out to a wire through the nape of the neck, and a computerized system to which the wire would be connected. The implant would stimulate brain tissue to produce a heightened state of awareness during dreams, and the computer would record sensations and visuals to produce as text. The text would require additional human processing, but the final product was a largely-accurate transcription of what the subject says and does, including while dreaming.""")

All members of SWORD team were given medical and neurological workups before entering into a secure padded containment chamber aboard the Phantom. They were seated in restrained reclining medical chairs with various instruments attached to the sides, leading to displays of neurological activity, heart rate, and similar readouts. IVs of class-W mnestics were inserted into the arms of all personnel (barring SCP-1867, who had a small amount mixed into the bowl of seawater in which it was placed).

GALANIS: Hey!

GALANIS: Aw, that's… disorienting. Where on Earth are we?

GREAVES: Hopefully, the Astral Plane. Do you see any of the others?

GALANIS: No, but listen.

GREAVES: What is it?

GALANIS: No, like — listen.

The howling accompanying them drifts along the nonexistent wind to the pair. They turn, and in the distance lies some sort of stone structure, obscured by a vast collection of tall trees.]

GREAVES: …That sounds remarkably similar to the whispering noise in Mamjul me and Operator Desai kept hearing. Seems like something worth investigating.

GALANIS: Hey, hold up. We need to wait for the others.

GREAVES: We don't know how things work here. If we're in the same astral space, or if they're ahead of us.

GREAVES: With any luck, they're already there and we're the stragglers.

GALANIS: Yeah. Maybe. But if they're not there, we're turning back.

[Out of the fog and mist, a silhouette of a group of figures emerge. DESAI, MORELLO, and an unknown yet familiar figure step out. The third is an older gentleman dressed in a waistcoat, trousers, and boots with spats. A derby cap sits atop his brown-haired head, laden with a boyish grin despite his age.]

DESAI: Hey, Dora!

GALANIS: Ajay! And… Lord Blackwood.

SCP-1867: Quite right. Welcome to the Astral Plane, my friends and motley companions. Disorienting, isn't it?

GREAVES: I've seen worse.

SCP-1867: Yes, well, careful not to think yourself into the abyss. Quite an ugly fate, that would be. Hardly a body left to bury. Onwards!

DESAI: Onwards where?

GALANIS: I'd bet… that thing, in the distance.

MORELLO: Castle?

DESAI: Looks that way. Or a fortress or something. Hell of a treeline, though. And that noise sounds—

GALANIS: The whispering you guys heard in the ruins.

DESAI: Yeah. Yeah. Probably time to head there, then.

[Extraneous chatter clipped for brevity.]

[SWORD team finally begins to approach the structure, passing through a line of impossibly tall, broad-leafed jungle trees. Vines hang from the canopy high above and shrubbery layers the ground. The growth is thick, but the trees and undergrowth seem to shift, making way for the group's march forward.]

DESAI: How welcoming.

GREAVES: Be on alert.

MORELLO: Trees this tall don't exist on Earth. These have to be… 500 feet, at least. Holy hell.

A huge archway dominates, through which a great door is ever-so-slowly opening.]

GALANIS: Holy fuck.

[The door completely opens. The ground in this portion of the plane is layered over with dirt and soil, and the group walks through the doorway. They are in a massive, intact city, temple-like buildings rising for stories in all directions. In the far distance, at the center of the city and at the end of the long avenue on which they currently stand, the topmost portion of a huge tree can be seen, its branches spreading atop the sky. The chanting and drumbeats are louder than ever, and in every direction there is bacchanalian celebration — huge figures fill the city shoulder-to-shoulder, engaged in revelry. The entities vary in shape and appearance, but all are tall, in excess of 3m. They have pale mint skin, long curling horns sitting atop their foreheads, and digitigrade legs. They drink, dance in intricate patterns, and sing their chanting harmony in tune with the huge drums. However, they leave the main broadway entirely empty for the group to walk through, looking at them.]

MORELLO: Alive.

GALANIS: Yeah. The Daeva never died out. The Covenant just did.

Buildings and temples that could only be three or four stories shoot into the distance, craning the neck.

Drawn along, the group is pulled forward, down the broadway, towards the Citadel. As they move through the great streets of the city, the grander it becomes — the plain gray stone of Mamjul has been painted over with bright, resplendent shades of reds, purples, and gold trimming. The tall horned Daevas' green skin makes a sharp contrast against the warm buildings they occupy. The raucous wildness only increases in intensity, many of the entities openly engaged in intoxicated, violent combat. In the distance, over the city's rooftops, gigantic beasts of burden almost as tall as the trees slowly move across the skyline on hundreds of legs.]

GALANIS: I… don't know.

[The movements and lapping of the crowd gently push the group forward, but not aggressively. Many of the Daeva are joyous at the sight of them, clasping their hands and raising them before letting them go. Eventually, they arrive at the entrance to the tunnel leading into the Citadel. The drumming and loudest singing can be heard from inside, and they progress in. Where the tunnel in Mamjul was filled with carvings, living Daeva line the passage here, beating fists against the stone-wood walls in song. The group exits out into the throne room. It contains two thrones, both carved from the same titanic vein of wood. On the left sits a human corpse, features made indiscernable by its age. It is dressed in elaborate finery and a wreath. The throne on the right is occupied by a female Daeva in similarly elaborate dress, leading the song encompassing the entire city.

As witnessed by Saudivalatra, Third Rajmata of the Scarlet Maharaja.
And as the Empire spread across the face of the continent in the name of the Scarlet House of the Daeva, it was soon that they came to know those that had arisen in the East and West in the thousand years of isolation. The blood-mad Nälka of Black Aditum, the great dark necropolis borne of Mamjul's own sin and rent from the body of the High Slave, took arms against the Daeva in their zealotry to extinguish the life from the Flesh. And the Mekhanites of Amoni-Ram, in their arrogance and disdain for the natural laws of the world, took arms agains the Daeva in their zealotry to make themselves more than human. And in the hopes of saving their people, the Covenant took the magic of the jungle against their aggressors and waged whole war, war in every aspect, war in every element.

Mamjul and Korar turned from peaceful metropoli to cities of war, and the Children of the Scarlet rushed out into the land, sorcerer-nawabs leading vast legions of Daeva and warriors and slave-soldiers into the cruelest faces of humanity.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Of the north of the Daeva, once lay a dozen cities — now reduced to naught but ash and rubble over the course of the First War. The Zealots of Metal saw and learned the power of fire and lime, wielded freely against innocents, entire forests burned into cinders to deny the Daeva their home. Cities laid siege to, men bled, fuladh melted down into the very spears that would be driven through the bodies of the Mekhanites and into the wall of Mamjul, as a warning.

And of the Nälka was an even more violent confrontation, for their Lord Iun was a hateful beast, and his mindless forces ran amok, stretching wildly from the east and raising those who died in war back again, denying their souls their eternal rest in Korar. Their massacres were devoid of purpose, killing for the sake of killing, with no artistry to their butchery, no respect for the inborn soul, only a simpleminded desire for the purity of rent flesh, empty vessels. The cities of the Nälka were torn from the ground by the great vines of the sorcerer-nawabs, sundering walls, laying waste to all who dared to interrupt the dance of the soul.

And through all this, the three Cities lay unaware of the Wretch of the West, of its horde coming together, of the BLACKSTAR rising from the obscurity of a farming village to the head of the army of the damned. In our arrogance, we saw only each other — we dismissed the Fourth, who had been silently scheming for a thousand years, a vengeant eye watching the horizon, watching the rise of Amoni-Ram and Mamjul and Korar and Black Aditum, and casting a spectre of devastation upon the land as it made the slow, agonizing march to the great golden walls of the Gate of the West with only one thought in the mind of its prophet: death.

OPERATOR: Secure Ley connection established. Incoming signal from the FRS Lillihammer to Overwatch Command.

[The Leyspace activates, cycling through a number of locations before again settling on a corridor in the Bridge Archive, underneath Site-01. This time, only five of the seats by the large round table are filled.]

O5-1: Hello again, Doctor Galanis. At ease, Lieutenant Greaves.

GALANIS: Hello! Hello, everyone.

GREAVES: Sir.

O5-5: Pandora. It's been a minute, hasn't it?

GALANIS: Yes, and so much has happened… Can I ask where the rest of the Council is? I was, um, hoping to brief all of you at once.

O5-1: It's rare for all of us to be able to attend a meeting; last time was an anomaly, if you'll excuse the pun. Don't worry. We'll make sure the others are updated.

O5-7: Well, let's get on with it.

O5-1: Yes. Not to rush you, Doctor Galanis, but the floor is yours.

GALANIS: Thank you. As you all know, approximately three weeks ago we conducted the first astral projection test as part of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative. We weren't really aiming for anything in particular — but like we ended up stumbling into Mamjul, we stumbled right into Korar. An entire city on the astral plane. Mamjul is dead, but Korar is more than alive, it's thriving.

O5-7: Yes, yes, you told us this when asking for permission for a return trip. Get to the point, child.

GALANIS: Right. Well, the subsequent return trips have panned out very well. We've been in repeated contact with the Daeva, and have made some frankly astonishing inroads into developing an understanding of their culture. Our linguists have even constructed a preliminary model of the Daevic language — not that we desperately need it, we seem perfectly able to communicate on the astral plane. Our anthropologists are burning the candle at both ends interviewing and compiling the research.

O5-3: And you're on good terms with their… queen?

GALANIS: The Rajmata, yes.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" I've been leading all the return trips and getting the other personnel acquainted with the process of projection, with the help of SCP-1867. Obviously we've had to suddenly expand the roster of the Dream Team— sorry, of Omicron Rho.

O5-5: [Chuckles] Dream Team. That's clever.

O5-3: The idea that the entire race has continued to exist for three thousand years isolated in… whatever this is. It boggles the mind.

GALANIS: The astral plane. A reality constructed entirely of dreaming minds. We haven't really been able to construct a scientific basis for it yet.

O5-7: All a bit mumbo-jumbo for me, frankly.

O5-1: We've seen stranger things, Jean. What's your take on the situation so far, Doctor?

GALANIS: That's… a hard question to answer, sir. But we have things now that we didn't before: direction, and a primary source to get more knowledge from. The Rajmata has been really helpful with our researchers — mapping out the districts of Korar, explaining parts of her people's culture and how the Daeva think. Honestly, I think this is a breakthrough. On the same scale as the discovery of the Preserver entity in Amoni-Ram, if not bigger.

O5-7: And how well that went.

GALANIS: I'm not saying there aren't risks. I'm just — I'm saying that they're risks worth taking. We're all agreed in that we need what the Daeva have, right? There's an entire culture waiting for us to learn about them! History, anthropology, music, literature, and that's just the mundane aspects; we still don't know the kind of thaumuturgy they're capable of.

O5-3: We should be more focused on the latter. The humanities are important, but we're in Korar for one reason.

GALANIS: You can't— [Sighing] You can't try to understand what they're capable of without understanding what kind of a culture leads to that! It's like trying to understand American military technology without knowing anything about the U.S.""")

O5-3: True as that may be, I notice you haven't made much progress with determining the ultimate fate of the city.

GALANIS: The Daeva are… hesitant to share that. I'm still trying to find out why.

O5-1: I'll be frank with both of you. We've read the reports over the past few weeks, and heard your testimonies. And, of course, we have Alpha-1 reporting back to us. But this project has entered into a realm Amoni-Ram never did, quite literally. Our only exposure to Korar, to the Daeva still existing, to any of this is through the device inside your brain, Lieutenant Greaves.

GREAVES: I can assure you that I saw everything with my own eyes—

O5-1: I believe you, Lieutenant. That's not my point. My point is that you are now fully in uncharted territory. There are now dangers we likely don't even know about yet. There has been a not-insignificant push to have the Initiative cancelled, all personnel amnesticized, and the records sealed.

GALANIS: You — you can't do that!

O5-1: I think you know I can, Doctor. But I'm not going to. I told you, I'm a historian too. I still think that Mamjul and Korar hold incredible possibilities for the Foundation and for humanity, knowledge we need now more than ever. So we're not just letting the research continue, we're going to be offering new resources. More personnel, more support.

GALANIS: What's the catch?

O5-7: Smart kid.

O5-1: Going forward, Overwatch Command is going to be more involved in the Initiative. You'll still handle the day-to-day running, but Lieutenant Greaves acts with our authority, and is empowered to make executive decisions.

GALANIS: I— But— [Stuttering]

O5-1: Is there a problem, Doctor?

GALANIS: May I speak to you privately, Overseer?

[Silence.]

O5-1: You're dismissed for now, Lieutenant.

GREAVES: Sir, if I could—

O5-1: Dismissed, Lieutenant.

O5-1: You don't trust Lieutenant Greaves?

GALANIS: It's not that! It's just… I don't know how useful more oversight is going to be. It's a little stifling, honestly. The researchers keep coming to me with complaints about the Alpha-1 operators impeding their work and it's bad for morale and it's just… I don't think the Lieutenant has the best interests of the Initiative.

O5-1: I suggest you speak to him to see if the security can be integrated into your workflow better. Remember that we chose you to be in charge of this project, Doctor — you're within your rights to speak to Lieutenant Greaves if you think there's an issue, you're not a hostage here. His team is there for your own protection. But Lieutenant Greaves has been working for us for 12 years. In that time I've never known him to be anything less than perfectly reasonable and deeply loyal. You've been given a chance; you should extend the same courtesy to others.

GALANIS: I know. I know. You're probably right. I'll try.

O5-1: That's all I ask. I'll see you next week to discuss requisition reports. And Doctor?

GALANIS: Sir?

O5-1: Aktus was being crude, but he's right; we trusted the Preserver, and that ruined us. Keep a close eye on the Rajmata.

The realization that the Daevic Covenant was not an extinct civilization caused a sudden shock to Mamjul-Korar Initiative personnel and leadership. Authorization was immediately sought from Overwatch Command to establish preliminary diplomatic relations with the Covenant, and granted on December 17th, 2002. In the three weeks following Projection #01, 16 return trips were made by MTF Omicron Rho personnel, which had been expanded from its original roster of nine to thirty-five.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" This was largely due to the Psychotronics Division successfully producing RL-023, an animatropic drug that considerably lessened the preparation and training needed for a successful astral projection while also allowing for perfect recall after awakening, for transcription. Prior to this, RL-023 had only existed theoretically in Dr. Hadley Cadmus' research notes.

MTF Omicron-Rho's Projections #02 through #17 included personnel from every Division of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative, and were focused on a number of immediate goals:

I) ascertain the anomalous capabilities of the extant Daevic Empire and their current nature of existence;
II) establish diplomatic relations, if possible;
III) arrive at a clearer understanding of the culture of the Daevic Covenant;
IV) build a unified timeline of the Empire's fall, and establish the identity of the entity/group/party known as the Abominate;
Rajmata Vaslirasirraj-Shirat, the current ruling monarch of the Daeva, proved exceptionally receptive to diplomatic efforts and accomodating to Foundation personnel in Korar. An extensive Culture Briefing was compiled by the Anthropology Division with the assistance of the Rajmata and multiple visits to Korar.

ATTACHED DOCUMENT

Culture Briefing Excerpt
Societal Structure
The Daevic Covenant society is extremely rigidly caste-based, with roles in society occupied by dozens of complex interrelated castes. Broadly, they can be grouped into four categories. As with many ancient cultures, slaves occupy the bottommost rung of society, and are afforded few rights or luxuries. The Daevic Empire made extensive use of slaves in almost every line of work that could not be done through their arboromancy, from construction to agriculture to bureaucracy; we estimate that the Empire contained three slaves for every free citizen. This system was brutally enforced through both anomalous and mundane control methods and violence.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Testimonies from the Daeva indicate that the mass-killing of slaves was regarded as a kindness, as it freed their immortal souls to join the population in Korar.

Beyond the slaves, the castes were less rigidly separated. Freed laborers were afforded only a handful of rights above slaves. Merchants and artisans were in similar higher rungs of society, and soldier-nobles and sorcerers occupied the rung above them, being the landed aristrocrats. The topmost rung of society consisted of the matriarchs, or 'Scarlet brides', religious priestesses central to the Daevic religion (see § State Religion). These matriarchs dictated almost every matter of society by interpreting the will of their god. In a break from most ancient cultures, one of these brides, the Rajmata, was the sovereign monarch of the Empire, rather than a male member of the landed gentry; she was considered married to the Scarlet Maharaja while it slept in Korar, and the embodiment of its will in Mamjul and on Earth, empowered to make all theocratic, military, and societal decisions for the Covenant.

[Following ingestion of RL-023 in the Psychotronics Lab aboard the FCS Haffkine, Doctor Galanis entered the fugue state associated with projection. Three minutes later, they open their eyes. They are in the Citadel of Korar, on one of the higher floors. Per the Rajmata's orders, it has been sequestered for Foundation use; several other researchers and agents and multiple Daeva are in the wide room, which is filled with naturally-flowing wood seating, tables, and other items. The omnipresent song is still audible, though much softer and more distant.]

DURHAM: Where are you going, Doctor?

GALANIS: Downstairs. I need to speak with the Rajmata. Don't wait up on my account.

[GALANIS turns towards the staircase but then stops, closing their eyes and focusing on the throne room. They open their eyes, and are there; the Rajmata is seated on her throne. The golden boughs of the Tree are overhead. GALANIS bows, spreading their labcoat.]

RAJMATA: Greetings once more, Galanis-hiyar.5

GALANIS: Hello again, Rajmata.

RAJMATA: Your people have been settling in well.

GALANIS: They have! They have. I wanted to thank you for that. You've been very accomodating. I can't tell you how much we appreciate it.

RAJMATA: Much as I appreciate your thanks, it is not entirely altruistic, my friend.

[GALANIS stiffens.]

GALANIS: Oh?

RAJMATA: My people have been alone for three thousand years. We crave new experiences.

GALANIS: Oh. [Relaxes] You want to know about humans?

RAJMATA: Yes. You are interesting creatures. Very different from us.

GALANIS: Well, I'm sure we can share some bits of us with you. If you're willing to do the same.

RAJMATA: [Sigh] I tire of this, Galanis-hiyar.

GALANIS: I know, I don't enjoy it either. But I'm not the final decisionmaker of the Foundation.

RAJMATA: We are sharing with you, my child. We tell you more of our culture every day.

GALANIS: We need more. We need to know what actually happened during the First Occult War. How the Empire collapsed.

RAJMATA: Why?

RAJMATA: I am not so sequestered that I cannot still walk among my people. Come.

GALANIS: I- yes, your grace.

GALANIS: I don't… see how asking to see your histories is such a monumental ask, your grace. Your people clearly—

RAJMATA: You are an historian, are you not?

GALANIS: I am.

RAJMATA: What do you look for in those fallen civilizations you seek to study? What are your methods of research?

GALANIS: Er, it can be many things. Primary sources — that is, someone who was there at the time — are the best, but aren't exactly easy to find in civilizations that are thousands of years old.

RAJMATA: I see. Other than that?

GALANIS: Artifacts and text records are the next best thing. Stone tablets, writings, carvings, anything that gives us insight into how a people thought. We have more advanced tools, too, but nothing beats hard evidence.

RAJMATA: And therein lies the problem.

GALANIS: What do you mean?

The slow-thrumming drumbeats of the music are audible under the chatter and shouting of the street. The crowd parts reverently to allow the RAJMATA and GALANIS to pass unimpeded, flanked by the Scarlet Brides.]

RAJMATA: It would be, to humans. You are rather disconnected from the natural order.

GALANIS: I wouldn't say that—

RAJMATA: I would. You know not what you do not know. But that's quite alright. We have our limitations as well.

GALANIS: What are those?

RAJMATA: We cannot touch the material plane without acting through intermediaries. Through our chosen people. Once, this was the People of the Jungle. Now they are gone, and we are isolated to our home, waiting for someone to find us. But, returning to the point, Korar is a living, breathing city. But you have explored Mamjul, yes?

GALANIS: What little remains of it.

RAJMATA: Yes. Verily, a tragedy. You'll have noticed a distinct lack of the sources you mentioned.

GALANIS: Yeah. Yeah, we didn't find any tablets, any writings, nothing.

RAJMATA: Why do you think that is?

GALANIS: The city's been two miles underwater for three thousand years, I assumed they'd all been destroyed.

RAJMATA: Destroyed, yes. But not by nature. By man. And not just in Mamjul — in Korar, and in every other city. Once, we had libraries filled with chronicles of our histories. Now, as they were destroyed in Mamjul, so too have they been destroyed here. There are no longer any writings, anything concrete that proves we existed.

GALANIS: Wait, what? You've been… written out of time?

RAJMATA: Yes. This is the tragedy of the Daeva.

GALANIS: How is that even possible?

RAJMATA: To answer this would be to explain to you what happened in the First War. I do not trust you with that part of my people yet.

GALANIS: I… see. But that's insane. No offense, your grace. But the idea that there's no longer any record of your people, vibrant as it is…

RAJMATA: You could call it that. Listen.

GALANIS: I don't hear anything. Beyond the noise, I mean.

RAJMATA: Silence your mind. Eliminate your thoughts. Listen.

It is in a language unspoken for thousands of years, at once unfamiliar and comforting. The thousands of voices that form the chorus are in perfect harmony as they sing.]

GALANIS: Woah. That's… I feel like I've heard this before.

RAJMATA: The Song of the Daeva. A musical arrangement that chronicles our entire history, from our conjoining with my Master, our God to the fall of Mamjul and the breaking of the Empire. Hundreds of verses, kept alive in our memories.

GALANIS: It's not written down anywhere?

RAJMATA: It was, long ago. A great library in Mamjul once held a stone tablet transcribed with each verse. Scholars and sorcerers from across the Empire would undertake pigrimages to Korar to seek the wisdom of the Song.

GALANIS: …I think we found that library.

RAJMATA: You found nothing more than blank slates and dead men. Now you see our shame. And why I hesitate to share it with you.

GALANIS: This is all you have left.

RAJMATA: Yes. It is not just our history — it is our religion, our creation, our laws, our culture. It is the Daeva. Sharing it with outsiders is the purest baring of our soul as a people.

GALANIS: Wow. No, yeah, I understand.

RAJMATA: But you have something we desire as well. Knowledge of the world since Mamjul fell.

GALANIS: Well, we would be willing to share that if you were willing to return the favor.

RAJMATA: Hm. I see.

GALANIS: That's all I ask.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" You've been incredibly generous already. I feel bad asking.

RAJMATA: Do not. You are far too skilled for the suffering you are undergoing.

GALANIS: What? I'm sorry?

RAJMATA: You are a troubled soul, Galanis-hiyar. I did not become Empress Consort for my appearances alone.

GALANIS: I— yeah, I know. I've got a lot going on. There's a lot riding on this being successful. On me being successful.

RAJMATA: You worry far too much for your age. Were all humans as you are… regardless, your offer is suitable, I think. But only for you.

GALANIS: What do you mean?

RAJMATA: Your fellows are intelligent, but they lack a certain level of wisdom and deftness that the Song demands. I will not allow them to take and pervert our history. I will translate it and share its meanings, but only with you.

GALANIS: Okay. Okay, that's fair.

RAJMATA: Good. We will begin on your next arrival. For now, allow yourself some rest. You certainly deserve it.

GALANIS: Thanks, but I'm—

[The RAJMATA reaches one hand down out of her robes, and places two long and slender fingers against GALANIS' forehead. With a sudden, violent rush, GALANIS demanifests from Korar and wakes up from the dream in the Psychotronics lab aboard the Haffkine.]

GALANIS: Huh.

ONEIRIC RESEARCH
Following this exchange with the Rajmata of the Daevic Empire, Doctor Pandora Galanis began sessions with her to accurately construct a historical record of the Empire concurrent with the fall of Amoni-Ram. The Rajmata offered both the religious framing of the Song of the Daeva as well as historical knowledge carried through oral tradition among the Daeva in the absence of a formal written record.

Personal thoughts on research progress


It's often said that the greatest wish a historian can have is to actually speak to someone from antiquity.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Even the most primary of primary sources face issues: translation problems, damaged or incomplete records, wholesale fiction being portrayed as fact to make long-dead kings look good.
I think I'm the first historian to actually have that wish granted.

Even the Preserver in Amoni-Ram wasn't able to give Nussbaum much in terms of testimony — its mind was too fragmented. Most of their knowledge came from the Fuladh Throne. But now I have a living, if not breathing, record of the Daevic Empire. The Rajmata and I sat down three times over the past week for her to explain the beginning verses of the Song for me. It's amazing. It's incredibly complex. Imagine every symphony you've ever heard overlayed with an unspeakably complex poem hundreds of verses long. It's a perfect representation of their culture — I mean, I literally can't even make some of the sounds necessary, since it's crafted for Daeva vocal cords!

The content is illuminating, too. We're still on the beginning verses, unfortunately — haven't been able to progress as quickly as I'd like. RL-023 aided projection has a pretty long cooldown time, about twice as long as the projection itself. And time passes differently in astral space, so it's hard to even tell whether the short conversation you had took eight minutes or eight hours. Every projection I've made has been followed by hours in recovery with the Psychotronics guys pumping me full of electrolytes and fluids. But god, the hours I do spend in the city.

Anyway, as I was saying, the beginning verses really just corroborate what we already knew. The creation myth mirrors that of Amoni-Ram quite closely — some kind of war or conflict between a pantheon of gods that resulted in all of them grievously wounding the others, and causing all of them to 'fall' to Earth. Though there is something notable: the Daeva reference four of these original gods, while the Mekhanites only acknowledge the existence of three.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" It has to have some connection to the Abominate. I just know it.

I'm unspeakably excited, but I know I need to be careful. The Rajmata seems… friendly, but I'm not taking chances — getting my CRV checked every single day and limiting my projections. She knows more than she's letting on, I can tell that much. She hasn't explained why she greeted us into the city with 'welcome back', or what the hell she meant when she said she'd only share it with me. I don't trust her. Not yet. But I have to keep moving forward.

I'm not letting this fall apart. Not again.

Culture Briefing Excerpt
State Religion
The Daevic Empire was a strict theocracy with a strong focus on animism. The Daeva were considered nature spirits and immutable evidence of the validity of the Daevic religion, but they were not the central objects of worship by citizens of the Empire. Instead, this role was occupied by an entity-concept known by many names — the Slumbering God, the Scarlet Maharaja, the Khan of the Scarlet House, or simply the Scarlet. The consistencies are self-evident; all representations of the god are strong in nature, primal instinct, natural order, violent survival of the fittest.

This entity, called the Scarlet here for simplicity's sake, was one of the gods cast down to the Earth when a war split the pantheon, landing in what is now the middle of the Indian Ocean but at the time was a lush jungle subcontinent. It became the king and sworn god of the nature spirits, and eventually connected these spirits with the fledgling tribal humans living on the subcontinent, by taking a human 'avatar' and forming the Daevic Covenant. This avatar is suggested to be an unspeakably powerful sorcerer, with abilities suggesting at least a Type-4 Class Blue entity — but is asleep, with their dreams forming the foundations for Korar's continued existence and the Empire's successful conquests.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Put simply, the Scarlet is the cosmic representation of the concepts of brutal primality, and the Scarlet Maharaja is its prophet in human form.

The religion of the Daevic Empire was one of unwavering, zealous commitment to the Scarlet Maharaja, as their dreams allowed for the continuation of the Empire. The systematic manifestion of this were the Scarlet Brides, an imperial cult of handmaidens, attendants, and priestesses (though many were also male or androgynous) that were considered literally wedded to the Scarlet Maharaja. Their favored wife among the Brides was the Rajmata, the queen ruling in their stead until the Maharaja awoke from his dream when the Daeva had conquered the entirety of Asia for them.

Hymns, magic, and sacrifices formed the basis of Daevic worship. Hymns and associated dances occupied a central place in Daevic culture and complex dances were a way to honor their god, and use of the magic gifted to humans by the Scarlet was a holy act in and of itself, with sorcerers akin to religious preachers. Human sacrifice was a core part of Daevic worship — it is estimated that over the thousand years of the Empire's existence, well over forty million people were sacrificed, most with religious intent in specially-constructed pits and many being children.. This was not seen as a cruelty by the Empire, as killing a human member of the Empire was believed to allow them to reincarnate as a Daeva in Korar, a more fulfilling and eternal life — but the fact is that the Empire practiced a level of brutal human sacrifice and slavery on a scale completely unprecedented in ancient history.

Over the following weeks, Doctor Galanis continued to sit in private sessions with Rajmata Vaslirasirraj-Shirat. Through these, several assumptions that Nussbaum Model had made regarding the parahistorical element to the Bronze Age Collapse were challenged and clarified.""")

[GALANIS re-enters the dream, after an hour spent on an electrolyte IV in the Psychotronics lab. They remanifest in a secluded antechamber of the Korar Citadel, high in the boughs of the tree of life. Overhead, a starry, lightning-streaked sky is frozen in time. The RAJMATA stands ahead, draped in embroidered and bejeweled shawls.]

RAJMATA: Returned from your rest, Galanis-hiyar?

GALANIS: Yes. Yeah. I'm sorry, I know this is—

RAJMATA: Quite alright. You are small, and frail. Your physical needs must be met.

GALANIS: …Not quite how I'd phrase it, but I appreciate the sentiment.

[The RAJMATA bows her head, letting the shawl hang limply from around her horns.]

RAJMATA: My sincerest apologies.

GALANIS: You're fine! You're fine. It's just a lot to take it in at once. You were discussing the middle ages of the Daevic Covenant.

RAJMATA: Yes, but I worry that my explaining does you little good when I can show you.

GALANIS: [Pause] Show me?

RAJMATA: Observe.

[The RAJMATA locks her hands, lowering her head. The latent noises of Korar's hustle and bustle far below seem to melt away, leaving only the slight shifting of the leaves. Then the RAJMATA begins to sing. With her large size and vocal cords, the sound is incredibly deep and rich, with guttural lows and humming highs. As she sings, it sounds as though multiple voices from across the tree join in the chorus.]

GALANIS: This is the song you showed me before. The Song of the Daeva.

[The RAJMATA stops to speak. The song continues unabated.]

RAJMATA: Yes, but now we must go a step farther.

[The RAJMATA begins to dance with the music. She is graceful despite her large size and heavy dressage, drifting slowly in complex motions around GALANIS.]

GALANIS: This is beautiful, but— holy shit.

[Outside of the tree's boughs, the cityscape has shifted dramatically.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Instead of the abstract starry void of the astral plane, the tree now looks out over a city on Earth, with lush green farmland stretching into the jungle beyond the gigantic stone walls. It is a mirror image of Korar's triangular shape. The open-air markets that make up the northern portion of the city are still present, but now they contain both humans and Daeva living and interacting side-by-side and filling the streets. Huge multi-legged beasts of burden move throughout the city, mounted by both humans and Daeva in elaborate robes and headdresses.]

GALANIS: Is this time—

RAJMATA: No. The astral plane is a land of dreams, formed of the mind of the Sleeping Scarlet — my master. This is my dream. My memories. I bare my soul to you, in friendship, in trust.

GALANIS: That's… This is how Mamjul was?

RAJMATA: Yes. Once. I was the last Rajmata of the Daevic Covenant, and this is how I choose to remember my city and the Daeva.

GALANIS: But those are humans down there, not just Daeva. You lived side by side.

RAJMATA: 'Daeva' is simply a word — in your tongue, the best meaning would be 'chosen people'. The Scarlet named us this when she became our king-of-kings. In turn, we named the tribes of the land this when we chose to become one with them under the Covenant. The people, the spirits, the Empire, the magic — all are Daeva, all are the Children of the Scarlet, all are one.

GALANIS: Amazing.

RAJMATA: Look out, and see Mamjul at its summit. The peak of a civilization, the jewel of an empire that spanned the length of Asia. Food, knowledge, history, art. And of course, magic. All of it passed through Mamjul and from Mamjul, Korar. All are one.

[GALANIS watches the activity below. A team of Daeva and humans work to repair a fallen building. A man dressed in red-green robes slams a staff against the ground, and vines erupt out, lifting gigantic blocks of hand-carved stone from out of the hands of a contingent of human slaves.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""]

GALANIS: This doesn't look at all like a city at war.

RAJMATA: It is not. This is nearly seven hundred years before the sorcerers on the distant reaches of the Empire first informed us of the dreaded Golden Wave.

GALANIS: Golden— Ah. The Mekhanites.

RAJMATA: If that is what you choose to call them, then yes. The Mekhanites. A chauvinistic people from the Western desert, zealots of Mekkan, the Sister of the Scarlet.

GALANIS: Then this has to be over a thousand years before you were Queen. How can this be your memory?

RAJMATA: It is not my memory; it is my dream. A dream inspired by the soul of the previous Rajmatas, whom I carried with me then and carry even now. I hear, see, speak to them.

GALANIS: They had something like this in Amoni-Ram. A throne that would allow anyone to see in the eyes of a previous Emperor of the Bumaro Dynasty.

RAJMATA: Hmph. Artifice, borne out of a misguided obsession with improving oneself. All of Amoni-Ram's vast treasures were rubble and lost memories by the end of my reign. [Sigh] But for that matter, so were Mamjul's.

GALANIS: So what's so important about this day, this memory?

RAJMATA: Look. Look to the gate.

[At the far gate of the city, a large party is assembled. Hundreds of horses and other unknown beasts packed with supplies and wagons wait beyond the gates, and several humans and Daeva are saying goodbye to others inside. Many more slaves are assembled alongside them, naked and bare in the sun.]

RAJMATA: Our first attempt at establishing a colony far beyond the bounds of the Empire, another eye from whence our Scarlet Maharaja might see and arise to take stock of the world that was Theirs. Two thousand beasts and men, and twice as many slaves to carry the honor of the Children of the Scarlet. The expedition, prepared for years. The leaders assembled, with great artisans, merchants, general, sorcerers, nawabs, all walks of life, and sent out into the far emptiness of the East, towards the Endless Sea.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" They leave today.

GALANIS: There was another city of the Daeva?

RAJMATA: No. After they left the bounds of the Empire, we never hear from them again. Not for eight hundred years.

GALANIS: Wait. Wait, the Aegean Tablets mention this. Black Aditum, the city of the Nälka, was originally a slave colony. This… this is them?

RAJMATA: Yes. Today, you witness the birth of our blood enemies. Among those two-thousand slaves, one is a mere boy who will take the name Iūn and lead an insurrection. He will become the Scourge of the Coast, High Lord of the Nälka, Yaldabaoth's Prophet. He is a slave, and his parents were slaves. His hatred for us is inborn, and will cause millions to perish.

GALANIS: Good god.

RAJMATA: Nothing is alone. Everything is of two sides. The greatest peaks of our Empire are counterbalanced by the creation of the Red Death. All is one. Though not even Iun will be enough to bring death to the Daevic Empire.

GALANIS: What will?

RAJMATA: In due time, Galanis-hiyar. For now, appreciate this — a snapshot of our greatest achievement.

GALANIS: Mamjul.

GALANIS: I know. Sorry. Bad joke.

GREAVES: It's alright. Can I help you with something?

GALANIS: Maybe. I'm not—

[GALANIS sighs.]

GREAVES: Is something wrong, Doctor?

GALANIS: Look, can we just talk?

GREAVES: What, did you think you'd walk in and find me cleaning my rifle?

GALANIS: Kind of, yeah.

GREAVES: Well, if you'd come in ten minutes earlier, you'd be correct.

[They laugh.]

GALANIS: Have you gotten some time to look over the last projection log debrief I wrote? The one from last week.

GREAVES: I looked over it, yes. But I don't think I've seen any of the ones you finished since.

GALANIS: That's because I haven't.

GREAVES: You haven't reentered Korar for a week? Why?

GALANIS: The last one kind of shook me up a little, if I'm being honest.

GREAVES: …You're talking about the memory-sharing, right?

GALANIS: Yeah. When I was at Site-23 working on the Amoni-Ram Initiative, I was the first person to look through reports of the Fuladh Throne, what it could do. It reminds me of that a lot. And I don't like that.

[GREAVES stiffens.]

GREAVES: Have you—

GALANIS: I took a whole battery of Hartwell-Pugh tests. My CRV hasn't changed, no cognit influence detected in any one of the 13 tests. I took a CT and an MRI after that, and no change in brain function or structure. And I feel fine — Ajay said I wasn't acting weird, and he refuses to go near the Rajmata because she creeps him out.

GREAVES: I see. But you're still worried.

GALANIS: I'm still worried.

[They sigh.]

GALANIS: Look, I know we haven't been on the best of terms. But you're the person they put in charge of making sure I don't go insane, so can you go with me next time I project? Ajay is coming, but…

GREAVES: You want someone whose judgement won't be clouded. Sure, Doctor.

GALANIS: Oh. Well, thanks.

GREAVES: You were expecting an argument?

GALANIS: I mean, yeah. Like I said, we aren't exactly on the best of terms.

GALANIS: I didn't consider that, honestly.

GREAVES: Everything's a matter of perspective. Most people don't go beyond their own unless pushed. No offense.

GALANIS: None taken. You have to recognize that kind of bias in my field. Only way to work past it. Everything's a matter of perspective.

[They sigh.]

GALANIS: That heuristic has been seeing a lot of use in my reports lately, hah.

GREAVES: Mhm. But you see now why my team is so involved.

GALANIS: I get it. But at the same time, you're dudes with guns walking around and inspecting everything. I'm trying to manage over two hundred researchers, and I can't do that if they all feel like they're hostages.

GREAVES: Hm. I can understand it, I suppose. I'll tell them to ease off a bit.

[GALANIS smiles.]

GALANIS: I appreciate it. Really. Also appreciate you willing to project into Korar with me. I got the vibe that it's… really not your wheelhouse.

GREAVES: I've spent most of my life holding or avoiding a gun. This stuff with dreams and souls, it's confusing.

[He shrugs.]

GREAVES: But I'm the one with the million-dollar Kodak in his head, so I guess we've got to get our money's worth.

[They chuckle, before falling silent.]

GALANIS: I feel bad laughing. It's gotta be uncomfortable.

GREAVES: I knew what I signed up for when I joined the Council's Right Hand. Some of the guys have much worse alterations than this.

GALANIS: Still, though.

GREAVES: I've been with the Foundation for long enough that I'd do a lot worse than having a couple pins in my head. We're protecting the world out here; I do my part,

GALANIS: I can respect that. Me, I'm more here for the study of it — so much we still don't know about the world. It fascinates me, academically.

[GREAVES opens his eyes. He is standing outside of the entryway tunnel to the Citadel of Korar, with Doctor GALANIS and Operator DESAI alongside him. The RAJMATA stands before them, supported by her handmaidens, their faces obscured by red veils. The Daeva give the group a respectful berth.]

RAJMATA: You have brought guests, Galanis-hiyar. This was not what we agreed upon.

GALANIS: I know. I'm sorry. But this is too much for me to take in alone. It's an incredible amount of information. Ajay and Lucian are good people, though. I trust them. You can trust them.

DESAI: We've met before, uh… your Majesty?

GALANIS: It's "your Grace".

RAJMATA: The titles do not matter. Your tongue does not have the words necessary to convey the meaning of my full titles. It is of no concern.

[The RAJMATA turns to look at Greaves.]

RAJMATA: You. I remember you. Your soul is aflame. A soldier.

GREAVES: Yes.

RAJMATA: Interesting. A warrior and a scholar. In my land, our soldiers were often slaves, conscripted and made to fight with the promise of freedom. Is the same true for you?

GREAVES: No. I choose to fight. There are things in this world worth protecting.

GALANIS: Are we entering the dream again?

[Rather than answer, the RAJMATA bows her head and begins to sing, with her handmaidens joining in the chorus. The song is slow and grand, deep sweeping notes and movements in an impossibly deep tone.

GREAVES: I see what you mean.

DESAI: Woah.

GALANIS: We're not going to the top this time?

RAJMATA: No. There is something you must understand before you continue forward blindly. You tell me you went to Amoni-Ram, that you spoke with a surviving automaton of theirs.

GALANIS: Yeah.6 Well, not me personally, but the Foundation did.

RAJMATA: And what did it tell you about the Gods?

GALANIS: That there were three. Mekhane, your Brother Scarlet, and an unnamed deity that the Nälka worshipped.

RAJMATA: It lied to you. There are four. There have always been four corners to balance the world.

DESAI: The Abominate.

RAJMATA: It has many names. We refer to it as the Wretch. I believe the Nälka called it the First Apostate, in their infinite arrogance. Its true name cannot be spoken, but we accept its existence. The Mekhanites did not until it was upon their borders, and by then, it was far too late.

GALANIS: What is it?

RAJMATA: What I can say is limited. But I will tell you what I know. I. Now, look.

[The RAJMATA turns and enters the tunnel leading into the Citadel. The group follows. The interior of the tunnel is lighted with small fires lit at the tips of darkened vines. The firelight reveals a complex carving engraved into the walls of the tunnel.""")

GALANIS: The Scarlet.

RAJMATA: Yes. I have already told you of this, of how the Covenant came to be with the hopes of one day arousing our Sleeping God after we had delivered the world to him as a gift. Of how the Red Maharaja was selected by the Scarlet as her champion after he fell from the Heavens.

GALANIS: Right, yes. That actually leads into a question I wanted to ask…

RAJMATA: Speak.

GALANIS: Well, the Scarlet is the primal concept of nature, and the Maharaja is its chosen prophet. But the Scarlet is… a spirit, right? Just an incredibly powerful one, a god.

RAJMATA: Yes.

GALANIS: I guess my question is where the Scarlet is. Where the Scarlet Maharaja is. Physically.

[The RAJMATA stops and looks at GALANIS strangely.]

RAJMATA: The Scarlet is present all around us.

GALANIS: Right, I know, but like… Amoni-Ram was constructed on the back of Mekhane, made of her parts, physically.

RAJMATA: I think I understand what you are asking. Whether there is a place you can speak to my master.

GALANIS: I guess so, yeah.

[The RAJMATA places a hand against the tree.]

RAJMATA: Such a place exists, but the reliquary of my master must be protected. It is his dream that allows Korar to exist. To open him to an outsider would be…

[Pause.]

RAJMATA: I am sorry, but I cannot allow it. For your sake as well as his. It would be like placing sand in a raging river. The sand is obliterated, and the river tainted.

GALANIS: Yeah, okay. I understand.

RAJMATA: But as you mention Amoni-Ram being built off the back of their goddess…

[The Rajmata stepped forward, pointing to a new portion of the carving.""")

GALANIS: Mekhane.

GREAVES: And the first Bumaro.

RAJMATA: Yes. This was the pattern. Four gods, four prophets, four corners to the earth, four empires. One war. All is one. Our Gods are grand creatures, but they demand vessels for their power.

[GALANIS moves to the other side of the tunnel. This carving is substantially less detailed, and looks almost haphazard. It might depict some form of four-legged creature laying face down in a gargantuan grave or pit, surrounded by onlookers.]

GALANIS: This one… is this Iun?

RAJMATA: Our best approximation. We know very little about what exactly Iun discovered when he founded Black Aditum. He was a secretive, vindictive animal. We understand it was a god of flesh, but that it did not choose him as its avatar. Not willingly.

GALANIS: What does that mean?

RAJMATA: I wish I knew, Galanis-hiyar. These are renderings of rumours of legends of myths. The truth may have been nothing like this.

DESAI: History in a nutshell.

GALANIS: Then…

[The group moves to the last of the four large carvings near the entrance. In stark contrast to the others, this one shows only a single smooth, featureless circle on the wood wall.]

RAJMATA: The Wretch. As I said, what I can say is… limited.

GALANIS: Why?

RAJMATA: I am powerful, but I am not a god. There is binding magic that surpasses even ours.

GREAVES: Someone sealed your ability to talk about it?

RAJMATA: Yes.

GREAVES: It's not unheard of. There are anomalous contracts, geases, that take away your ability to talk about something. But something on this scale… I can't imagine the kind of power it would take.

GALANIS: I imagine who and why are also bound.

RAJMATA: Unfortunately. What I can say is that the Wretch was once a god, just the same as Mekkan and the Sleeping Scarlet and whatever Iun found.""")

DESAI: What did it do?

RAJMATA: The First Sin. I don't know what it is. But it was the introduction of disorder into a perfectly balanced universe. The first vestiges of chaos.

DESAI: Jesus.

GALANIS: Okay, so — wait. The Mekhanites didn't recognize the legitimacy of the Wretch or the Abominate or whatever, or your gods. They rationalized Mekhane as the only legitimate deity. But you guys… do?

RAJMATA: We don't pledge our allegiance to the Sleeping Scarlet because they are innately supreme over their brethren. We do it because they have protected us, uplifted us, provided for us. We swear fealty because we choose to. It is a partnership.

GALANIS: A covenant.

RAJMATA: You see now. All is one.

GALANIS: But the others don't follow that belief.

RAJMATA: No. Which is why the First War was inevitable. Look.

[The scene changes. The group and the RAJMATA are now standing on the battlements of the northern wall. Outside the gates, a gargantuan group has been assembled — at least hundreds of thousands of Covenant, both human and Daeva, gathered into camps.

[In the far distance, over the thick treeline and expansive jungle, several thick plumes of smoke are visible rising into the sky.]

RAJMATA: You will see the war as I saw it.

[The scene changes rapidly. A desert battlefield, littered with the corpses of hundreds of Mekhanites, their metal limbs torn from their bodies by Daeva scouring the field.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" A large Daevic city set alight by Mekhanite napalm, burning to the ground in a raging inferno as women run screaming and carrying their children. The corpses of Daeva and Mekhanites being puppeteered across a strait by Nälka necromancers, forming a living body of bridges to allow their abominations to cross over to the crippled Daeva force on the other side.]

DESAI: [Under his breath] Jesus fucking Christ.

GALANIS: This is… carnage.

GREAVES: It's war.

[The scenes continue rapidly shifting. Daevic sorcerers raising vines to tear through Nälkan infantry, reducing them to bloody tatters of rotten flesh. Prisoners of war being massacred on altars as human sacrifices. Mass graves and killing fields.]

GALANIS: Please. Stop.

[The scenes abruptly stop and melt away. The group are once again at the top of the Tree. DESAI and GALANIS are holding their heads. GREAVES is not.]

RAJMATA: You see now. Has any war of yours held a candle to the carnage?

GREAVES: Maybe a couple. We have a saying. War is hell.

RAJMATA: War is hell. Apt. And one must consider that it was all pointless.

GALANIS: What?

DESAI: All that was for nothing?

RAJMATA: While we waged this brutal, continent-spanning war, the Wretch was coming. We had no idea it had built up its forces in the Far West, after dragging itself out of the sea. A horde that dwarfed our armies, led by an undying general-prophet — the BLACKSTAR. And it was dragging itself across the face of Africa, bathed in blood and worship and chaos, to Amoni-Ram, the Gate of the West. For vengeance.

Culture Briefing Excerpt
Thaumaturgy & Magic
Without active practitioners of the Daeva school of magic, it's difficult to make confident statements about its nature, especially in the framework of modern thaumaturgy which relies heavily on objective, metaphysical measurement.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" However, through Doctor Galanis' sessions with the Rajmata Vaslirasirraj-Shirat and 141 interviews conducted on Daeva by members of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative, much information has been assembled.

The first, and perhaps most important point, is that the magic the Daeva used was not simply herbomancy (the magic of manipulating plant life). More broadly, the Daeva practiced animancy, in line with their philosophies that everything in the world had a soul, the only difference being whether it was on the astral or the material plane. The Daeva are self-identified spirits of nature, which is why the vast majority of Daeva magic focuses on plants and wildlife, but this is a choice, not a limitation.

Several Daeva have attested to more esoteric uses of their magic than conjuring aggressive, hostile plant life and the encouragement of agriculture. Mamjul was once host to a university of kallya, scholars we would now liken to alchemists, chiefly concerned with encouraging the development of life to serve the Daeva. The most visible examples of this are the exotic many-legged beasts of burden observed in Korar and in Mamjul by Doctor Galanis — but this university also produced what we would now call bioweapons, highly-aggressive viral infections that could cause both anomalous and mundane damage on organic tissue. These infections would be loaded into glass vessels and catapulted into besieged cities.7

As with most forms of animancy, the 'magic' was in fact a contract of exchange between the spirit and the caster. Given the close bond that most spirits (the Daeva) and the casters (the humans they were bonded with) had, there was no incentive to outsmart and/or betray the caster as with djinns. Instead, the price was paid through the ritual blood sacrifice of a third-party — usually a slave or later, prisoner of war.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Magic was used in nearly every aspect of Covenant society, from the management and control of slaves (pheromone-based hypnotics) to construction and expansion (accelerated tree growth into the desired structures) to war (physical bonding of Daeva to Covenant soldiers).

As the Daeva supplying the spiritual power clearly still exist, there are no physical barriers preventing adequately-trained thaumaturges from studying and using Daeva magic.

[GREAVES opens his eyes. He is standing in the upper branches of the Citadel, next to Doctor GALANIS. The RAJMATA is seated in front of them, on a thick branch. No attendants are in sight.]

GREAVES: Pandora. Your Grace. Operator Desai isn't joining us?

GALANIS: No, he's leading a dive. We're still running occasional missions into Mamjul, seeing if we can find something, anything.

RAJMATA: You will not. It is like the slates; wiped clean. But today our knowledge aligns.

GREAVES: What are you talking about?

RAJMATA: You tell me your knowledge ends at the fall of Amoni-Ram, the great city of the Broken Empire.

GALANIS: Yes. The automaton told us that you and the Nälka made an agreement to lay siege to the city at once. You joined your armies to bring down your common enemy. And that the Abominate, the Wretch, whatever you want to call it, took advantage of the opportunity.

RAJMATA: Then it was wrong.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

GALANIS: What do you mean?

RAJMATA: [Voice rising and growing heavier] After everything I have told you about the history of my people and the Nälka, of Iun's First Hatred for us, of the carnage we laid upon each other, of their attempts to deny our fallen entry into the next life — what part led you to believe they would ever carry arms with us?

GALANIS: It's- I don't- I'm-

RAJMATA: We are not some capricious apostates who would betray our own for a chance at delivering a blow to the Golden Legion. Is that what you think us, having lived in our city and spoken to our—

[GREAVES steps in front of GALANIS.]

GREAVES: Back off. They couldn't have known, we're just going off the timeline Nussbaum created. It's not their fault we're going off bad information.

[The RAJMATA and GREAVES glare at each other for several seconds, before the Daeva lowers her head. Her voice returns to its usual, sing-song tone.]

RAJMATA: I apologize, Galanis-hiyar. The memories I wish to show you… they occupy a wounded space in my mind. They hurt to think of, much less display to others. And I have not felt such strong emotion in a very, very long time. I let it get the better of me.

GALANIS: [Shakily] I-it's alright. It's fine.

GREAVES: [Low voice] You're sure you're okay?

GALANIS: [Low voice] Yeah. Thanks. [Regular voice] It's alright. I shouldn't have pulled something out without confirming either. This is obviously a sensitive topic for you, understandably.

RAJMATA: I imagine that what the automaton told you was what the Mekhanites had written as the walls of Amoni-Ram toppled. The maddened, desperate rationalizations of how the most advanced people in the world had fallen. Surely it could only be if their worst enemies had banded together despite the centuries of conflict and bitter hatred, for then they could paint themselves as martyrs.

GREAVES: History is just a matter of perspective.

RAJMATA: Another wise platitude.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" The flawed perspective of the Broken Empire was the one you were fed. Nothing more than revisionism, intended to make themselves noble in their own histories. Even with the walls of their greatest city sundered and the enemy at the gates, they expected their empire to live on in the other Rams. Pure hubris.

GREAVES: Then tell us what actually happened. Give us your side of the story.

[The RAJMATA lowers her head and begins her chant. Once again, the branches of the tree melt away, swirling into colors, forming a new scene. The brown and green become beige and golden yellow. Over the chanting, the image solidifies: the group is on a sand dune overlooking a huge war encampment. Tens of thousands of Daevic soldiers and beasts of war, gathered around bonfires and tents. In the distance, Amoni-Ram burns. Its walls lie nearly cracked open, the huge gates sheared. Fires of all kinds and sizes dot the skyscrapers and minarets, and a thick plume of smoke hovers over the city. Another army, this one too far to make out, crowds the eastern gate.]

GALANIS: Oh, man.

RAJMATA: There was never any alliance between us and the Nälka. I know not why they came to Amoni-Ram that day — but I sense it was for the same reason as I. We saw the signals; I heard a whisper, one of the sought-after signs from the Sleeping Scarlet of something he sees in his dream. A portent of things to come, and it told me that Amoni-Ram would fall not to me, not to Iun, but to a face not seen in a thousand thousand years, and it would fall on this night. I ordered the armies to march posthaste. I expect Iun received a similar portent, through whatever unholy magic he practices, of bone and fortune.

[She sighs.]

RAJMATA: It was already fallen when we arrived.

[GREAVES turns to the RAJMATA.]

GREAVES: You sound… sad. I thought you and the Mekhanites were blood enemies.

RAJMATA: We were. But it was a conflict that we knew, and that we understood.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" We were evenly matched — horns locked, none of us could destroy the other, and none of us would betray our allegiances with the notion of a truce.

[She sighs.]

RAJMATA: Do not misunderstand me: the Mekhanites were as much of a warlike blight to us as the Nälka. But I am not too proud to admit that Amoni-Ram was a center of learning, knowledge, and progress that rivalled even Mamjul. The razing of the city did not just put your people back a thousand years. It directly led to the fall of my own. For that, I must lament.

[They all look back at the city. With a slow shearing noise audible even from their distance, one of the huge skyscrapers splits and collapses.]

RAJMATA: My scouts corroborated that there was a huge force of Nälka on the other side, and we assumed Iun had devised some black magic that could take the city. Fools that we were, we thought that the third army was the dead, raised by the Nälka. We knew that the treasures of Amoni-Ram would be a great boon to whoever seized them, and we could not allow the Nälka to seize them. My generals made the decision: once the gates fell, we would march in and loot the city.

GALANIS: Oh, god.

RAJMATA: So we did. By morning, the walls fell, and our armies moved in. We expected resistance but this…. this was chaos.

[The scene cuts to a rooftop in Amoni-Ram. The streets are littered with corpses, and fires burn in every direction. The Covenant soldiers and Daeva are armed in curved swords and colorful clothing, and push against the surviving Mekhanite troops. The Nälka necromancers move through the streets, raising dead civilians to join the fray.]

RAJMATA: A massacre. And do you see who benefitted from it? Why the Three-Prong Army didn't try to occupy the city after bringing down the walls?

GREAVES: The Wretch. It was letting you tear each other apart. Leave yourselves wounded and open for the killing blow.

RAJMATA: We walked right into it.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" I'm sure Iun thought the exact same thing, that I had brought down the walls and was going to seize the city. We massacred each other, all while the BLACKSTAR watched.

GALANIS: You keep mentioning that name — what is that? Why does it sound like that?

RAJMATA: Names have power. Some more so than others. The BLACKSTAR was the Wretch's chosen — as Bumaro was with the Metal, as Iun was with the Flesh, as my master was with the Scarlet. To lead its armies, to destroy the world in its name. He was a man in flesh, but a monster in soul. He could shape reality like sand in his fingertips; a demon amongst men. His atrocities only began with the rape of Amoni-Ram. Hark.

[The scene shifts once again to a distance away from Amoni-Ram. Half the Daevic army is still at the encampment. Suddenly, a low-pitched drone fills the air, growing steadily louder. The soldiers quickly get to their feet, pulling their weapons and looking around. The droning grows louder and louder, and just as it hits its crescendo, the towers and spires of Amoni-Ram vanish.]

GALANIS: Ah. There it is. Mekhane's Grace.

RAJMATA: You say you've visited Amoni-Ram. What happened to it? Why did it disappear, taking half my army and crippling my forces?

GALANIS: It was a superweapon. The last-ditch efforts of the Mekhanites, meant to transport the entire city away in the blink of an eye if it were ever besieged.

RAJMATA: What? Transported where? Are they alive?

GALANIS: It didn't work, not how it was supposed to. It moved the city into a pocket dimension and killed everyone and everything inside. Amoni-Ram was utterly ruined.

RAJMATA: Oh. I… I see.

[She leans back lowering her head and whispering.]

GREAVES: What're you doing?

RAJMATA: Offering a quick prayer for the departed, to my master. A part of me always held out hope…

GREAVES: We understand.

GALANIS: We're sorry.

RAJMATA: It is not your crime to apologize for. But you see now.

[They look at the empty spot where Amoni-Ram once was.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""]

RAJMATA: I was crippled. We were crippled. We hobbled the long march home, disorganized and routed. But what weighed heaviest on my mind was not my lost soldiers or the fate of the city. It was that the Wretch, hated enemy of the gods, demon of demons, had returned. And with the Mekhanites reduced to dust, half my armies gone, and the BLACKSTAR carving a path westward… Mamjul and Korar were next.

As witnessed by Rapplataray, Fifth Rajmata of the Scarlet Maharaja.
And once the Beast had laid waste to Amoni-Ram, torn the city asunder and set the armies loose to tear each other apart, it continued its dreadful march across the desert and into the jungles and forests of the Covenant. And in this it was victorious; for it had slaughtered the Grand Armies at Amoni-Ram, routing the men and spirits of the Daeva from the battlefield, sending them into a desperate retreat through the thickets and undergrowth, to Mamjul, to salvation.

And so it was that the armies of the Daeva were forced to abandon their peoples, their sacred charge and those of their children, as they formed a great mass, marching ceaselessly towards their stronghold, the ancestral home of the Daeva, where they could mount a defense. But as with all things, such decisions are rooted in sacrifices of blood, of honor, of duty. And the ultimate sacrifice was made a hundred times over. Loyal soldiers left to their devices against the chaos of the horde, knowing their deaths inevitable, taking solace in the fact that their deaths might preserve their afterlifes.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Because it was understood that were the BLACKSTAR to lead his armies across the isthmus and into Mamjul, he would lay siege to the city, and break it just as he had broken Amoni-Ram. The slaughter would be wholesale and complete, and not only of the material plane. For were the Three-Prong Army to bring down the walls of Mamjul, to seize the Tree, they would tear apart the roots seeking the original gift of the Scarlet, the source of the Maharaja's power. And should they take it from his sleeping corpse, he would crumble away to nothingness, robbed of his immortality. And as he crumbled, so too would the dream he dreamt, and Korar with it.

LATER RESEARCH
On April 11th, following several months of cooperative research from all teams of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative, the first revision of the Daevic Empire Cultural Briefing was finalized. The report covered nearly every aspect of cultural knowledge that the Daeva had been willing to share with Foundation personnel, and represented likely the first written record of the Daeva's existence in centuries, perhaps millennia. A meeting of the Anthropology Committee was called to discuss forward action.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): Morning, boss.

YIJUN (LING): Well? Don't leave us in suspense!

GALANIS: Mhm. After six months, several hundred interviews with the Daeva, and thousands of hours of research and cultural study by every member of the Initiative… I've transmitted the final draft of the Cultural Briefing, all nine-hundred-fifty-four pages of it, to Overwatch Command as of 8:02 this morning.

[The room bursts into cheers and claps. Several researchers high-five, hug or simply whistle. The celebration carries on for the better part of a minute, until GALANIS raises their hand and it dies down.]

GALANIS: I know not everyone's here, but for those of you that are, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. You guys did an amazing job — none of us knew what we were getting into when we made the first dive into Mamjul, but you've all handled the impossible job with an exceptional air of professionalism and duty. It's you guys that made this possible. Give yourselves a pat on the back.

[Another, more reserved round of applause rings out from the researchers lined up around the room.]

GALANIS: This is a huge milestone, but our work isn't over yet. The Briefing is a pretty exhaustive look at the culture and anthropology of the Daeva, but our historians still have a lot of work ahead of us. Additionally, I was informed by the Council that we'll be seeing some new faces within the week — a crew of researchers from the Applied Thaumaturgy Division are being flown out.

DESAI (DIVE): We're getting wizards?

[A polite chuckle rings out.]

GALANIS: I think they're technically mages, but yeah. The Council has a lot of interest in seeing the applications of Daevic thaumaturgy, so that's a new avenue of research. But the rest of us also have a lot to do — especially our Parahistory Team. You'll all get briefings from your team leads with your new research directives by the end of the day.

YIJUN (LING): I'm relieved, honestly.

GALANIS: Yeah? How so?

YIJUN (LING): If I never talk to a Daeva again it'll be too soon.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): I mean, you know what she's talking about.

GALANIS: I really don't.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): Come on, you guys read the same Culture Briefing I did. I mean, hell, we wrote it! The Daeva aren't exactly a squeaky-clean culture.

ABERER (ANTH): Such a thing doesn't exist.

YIJUN (LING): Sure, but like… you guys didn't find it weird or creepy when these huge creatures started talking about sacrificing their slaves?

RAMASWAMY (HIST): It was not enjoyable but one needs to keep an open mind about such things. They are from three thousand years ago; slavery and sacrifice being taboo are modern luxuries.

ABERER (ANTH): Such things were ubiquitous in the ancient world.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): Yeah, but we're not in the ancient world, are we?

ABERER (ANTH): The Daeva are.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): You guys seriously don't see anything fucked up about this? I wrote the section where we talk about finding the sacrifice pits in Mamjul. They were a brutal, militaristic culture.

YIJUN (LING): Yeah. Just because they existed back then doesn't mean they're exempt from judgement.

RAMASWAMY (HIST): Four hundred thousand people died in the construction of the Great Wall of China. Countless thousands of slaves in the construction of the Pyramids. We cannot apply our modern moral axioms to the actions of kings from a thousand years before democracy was even thought of.

GALANIS: I mean, yes, but those were mutual atrocities. The First War was rife with them from all sides.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): Dude, are you serious? Yeah, I think our culture is a little better than the people sacrificing kids to the blood god.

ABERER (ANTH): Are you trying to be reductive?

YIJUN (LING): I don't totally agree with Levi, but like, you guys do recognize what you're excusing, right? Their morals haven't changed — I bet if you went in and asked any one of them right now, they'd still tell you that yeah, enslaving 'lesser creatures' is okay.

ABERER (ANTH): We're approaching this from an anthropological perspective. Just because I find some things morally reprehensible doesn't mean I get to cast judgement over an entire culture. That's no basis for scholarly research.

GALANIS: Okay, look, everyone, I think we may have gotten a little too close to the subject of the research here-

RAMASWAMY (HIST): I do not believe getting close to the subject is always bad. Your close relationship with the Rajmata is the only way we have learned so much about the Daeva to begin with.

GALANIS: That's— I mean, yeah, you're right, but like, our work requires a little distance to be able to remain impartial.

YIJUN (LING): The Daevic language has forty different words for 'religious torture'. We've spent the better part of a year studying these things. Are you really telling me the image you've gotten isn't one of a brutal theocracy? How can you be impartial about that?

Personal thoughts on research progress


Well, today was shitty.
I didn't realize there was this kind of an ideological split among the leads. It's jarring. I don't know how to feel about it. On one hand, Karl and Vijay are right. The one thing they hammer into you throughout your undergrad, graduate school, doctoral work, your career, is that trying to apply modern moral conceptions to ancient cultures is foolish. That's how ethnocentrism starts. Our modern morals are a product of an exceptionally high quality of life, wealth, and lifespan. The Daeva didn't have that. Like almost all ancient empires, their culture was built off the back of a gargantuan apparatus of slavery, imperialism, and state violence.

But at the same time… it's a unique situation, right? The Daeva aren't ancient. Well, they are, but they're not extinct. It's not like you're talking about the Egyptian slavery system, where everyone involved has been dead for thousands of years. The Daeva still exist, and Yijun is right. They still hold these beliefs. The Rajmata certainly does.

Everything is a matter of perspective.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Whether the Daeva are a product of their time or a warlike empire… maybe both. It's more complicated than that. It's so complicated. I think we might have gotten a little close to the subject of research here. We had to immerse ourselves in the culture to learn what we did, but I'm not sure we've learned what immersing ourselves has done to our own perspectives.

Not to mention the fact that we still need to figure out what happened to the Covenant after Amoni-Ram fell. This new stuff about the Three-Prong Army and the Abominate/Wretch and the Blackstar… I'm looking through all our databases and plenty of mundane academic ones. I've come up entirely dry.

Except for one thing. Vijay caught it: the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses III. The basis for the mythology of the Sea Peoples. An unidentified culture group that sweeped through and laid waste to Asia Minor, Egypt, and the rest of the Mediterranean during the Bronze Age Collapse. We have no records of who they were or how they managed to annihilate a slew of powerful military states, just some Egyptian writings that prove their presence in the region.

But the Rajmata mentioned the Wretch had 'crawled out of the sea' and quietly built an army that proceeded to steamroll over every other culture on its way to Amoni-Ram. Writings in Amoni-Ram and the Rajmata's testimony indicate that the Three-Prong Army came out of North Africa, and the Sea Peoples would have had to push through Egypt if they wanted to get to Amoni-Ram. It's not perfect, and the evidence is circumstantial, but it's something.

Though it raises two more questions that have been nagging at me. The first: what happened to the historical records of the Wretch? If a culture really did sweep through North Africa and then obliterate half of Asia, there has to be some kind of archaeological record of it! It doesn't make sense.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

And the second: why would Robert Bumaro be so terrified of something from three thousand years ago?

▷CLOSE◁
Despite the finalization of the Culture Briefing, the primary goal of the Mamjul-Korar Initiative remained to construct an accurate timeline leading to the fall of the anomalous empires and identify the Abominate/Wretch. Dr. Galanis' sessions with the Rajmata had reached the Fall of Amoni-Ram in approximately 1200 BCE, which is where the historical model constructed by Dr. Hedvig Nussbaum ended. At this crucial precipice, the Council unanimously agreed to permit further sessions.

[GALANIS and GREAVES are standing in a a lush verdant rainforest. Ahead of them, the trees grow thinner, eventually turning into a wide clearing in which sits a large village. Several dozen large stone buildings and many smaller wooden huts form the low, flat settlement; the architecture is consistent with many of the constructions in Mamjul and Korar. Aside from the pair, there is no one else visible.]

GALANIS: What the hell? Where are we?

GREAVES: This is a dream. But I don't know where.

GALANIS: Where is everybody? The Rajmata isn't here. Nobody's here.

GALANIS: Woah! Sorry. You startled me.

RAJMATA: My apologies. But I had to gauge something.

GREAVES: What?

RAJMATA: Whether you were able to recognize an ambush. Look.

RAJMATA: A brief spell by one of the sorcerers. Simply a temporary measure.

GREAVES: What for?

RAJMATA: For this.

[Distant, a horn sounds, growing closer. For a minute, nothing happens. Then a massive, black horde rushes out of the trees, charging the Daeva line. The Daeva flanks rush forward, crashing into the enemy. Shouting, yelling, and screaming immediately fill the air, punctuated by the horn and the steady beats of war drums.]

GALANIS: Those aren't the Nälka. They're… human.

RAJMATA: The BLACKSTAR's horde, the Three-Prong Army.

[They watch as the soldiers charge out of the treeline. They are human warriors, dressed in dark armors and leathers, tanned skin visible underneath. The generals and leaders are clothed entirely in suits of plated armor. They don't appear to use any specific kinds of magic or anomalies — just simple bronze weapons and wooden siege engines, their sheer numbers and ferocity enough to force the Daeva backwards.]

GREAVES: They just look like any old painting of ancient soldiers. What was their deal?

RAJMATA: They scorned our magic. Not just that of the Daeva; all of ours. The Nälka, the Mekhanites as well. They had no qualms using it against us, but they were not believers.

GALANIS: They must have had some kind of advantage, if they were able to take Amoni-Ram and give you a fair right.

GREAVES: You recalled the armies to Mamjul?

RAJMATA: No. Not to Mamjul. To Thijam, a smaller city on a narrow isthmus, forming the link between our peninsula and the mainland.

GREAVES: A choke point.

RAJMATA: Yes. The Three-Prong Army was far larger than mine. I had to reduce their numbers, so I elected to trap them at Thijam. But that took several months of full retreat. Our armies scavenging the land for sustenance while running, tails tucked between their legs, from Amoni-Ram back to the homeland. But if we didn't offer any resistance, the faster and lighter armies of the Wretch would catch up. With no supply trains, no civilians, nothing weighing them down… they would catch up, and they would massacre us.

GREAVES: Oh, no.

GALANIS: What is it? I don't understand?

GREAVES: It was a feigned retreat. But she had to leave behind just enough soldiers to put up resistance and prevent the pursuing force from catching up. No chance of victory, just buying time and hoping the main force escapes.

GALANIS: Abandoning entire armies to the wolves.

RAJMATA: They were sacrifices. They knew this. Thousands of soldiers, left behind in abandoned settlements as pockets of resistance. They were little more than bumps in the road. The Wretch washed through from the desert, pushing through the last vestiges of the Mekhanite territory before smashing into our own.

[The RAJMATA sighs, and looks at the carnage occurring past the tree line. The Three-Prong Army is massive — endless soldiers dressed in black metal armor and armed with long pikes, lances, and saw swords continue to pour out of the trees.]

RAJMATA: So many lost.

[The scene begins to cycle. It switches to a similar scene in a more temperate jungle that is aflame. The Covenant and the Three-Prong Army clash amidst thick foliage and underbrush set on a rapidly-spreading fire. Charred bodies litter the ground, and a number of Daeva are covered in fire eating away at them.""")

A huge force of Wretch cavalry on massive black horses crash into the waiting phalanx and shatter it, routing the army. The Abominate's forces lay siege engines against the walls of a settlement, leaping over the battlements while artillery barrages the defenses. Dozens of scenes like this play out.]

RAJMATA: He destroyed my Empire long before he took Mamjul. We abandoned cities, people, spirits, everything to the horde. We were walking dead.

GALANIS: Who?

[The RAJMATA points a long hand forward. In every scene, a figure is visible. Dressed in the intricately-formed black armor of the Three-Prong Army, his head is obscured by a large, spiked metal crown. His shoulders are draped in a long, dark cape. Unlike the rest of the soldiers, his only weapon is a single sword hanging by his side. Rather than charging headlong into the fray, he remains on the front lines but in a rearward position. His expression is obscured.]

GREAVES: He must be their commander.

GALANIS: The Blackstar.

RAJMATA: Yes. The blood of nations drenches him. One of the most powerful beings to ever walk the face of this planet.

GALANIS: He just looks like… a regular person.

RAJMATA: He is not a human. But he was, once. That is what makes him so dangerous. Why we could not face him directly on an open field, why I had to abandon my men to the wolves while I bought time..

GALANIS: What were you buying time for?

RAJMATA: I recalled the home guards of our smaller cities to the Isthmus of Thijam.

[The scene shifts to a view of a small, largely-empty narrow strip of land with seas on either side. A ramshackle village of straw huts and roots is visible near one of the beaches.]

RAJMATA: It was once a quiet fishing village. Slaves would man vessels from sunup to sundown, bringing in their catch to be sold.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" There was an annual festival, wherein the catch would be slaughtered along with a number of slaves, their blood mixing and pouring into the sea, making the surf run red with blessings. This tiny strip of land connected us to the mainland, allowed us to trade with the fledgling city-states of your people.

[In fast-forward, a large, disorganized party of Daevic soldiers arrive from the north and make camp on the southern side of the isthmus. They are followed in quick succession by more forces — bloody armies arriving in retreat from the north under scarlet banners, fresh reinforcements from the south, beasts of war, siege engines. More and more soldiers arrive, the encampment swelling to at least a hundred thousand troops, stretching far into the south, until they stop.]

GREAVES: What, then? Just lying in wait for them to come and kill you?

RAJMATA: Quite the opposite.

[A line of finely-dressed sorcerers stretches down the width of the isthmus, at least twenty-five kilometres. They dig their hands into the ground and, with an inhuman effort, raise the beginnings of a wall, made of intertwined stone and sand and root and vine, petrified and hardened. It slowly rises out of the ground, inch by inch, until the sorcerers collapse, many of them clearly exsanguinated of all the blood in their body. Soldiers rush forward with tools, fortifying and expanding the structure, even as the dead sorcerers are replaced, their blood spilt into the foundations of the wall, and replaced. The cycle continues as the sun sets and rises and sets and rises, until the wall is dozens of meters high and as thick as a building. Staircases and ladders let soldiers man the high battlements.]

GALANIS: That has to be as tall as the Great Wall of China. No, taller. By a lot.

GREAVES: Thicker, too. How did you manage this without… architects, construction machines, anything?

RAJMATA: Do you see the gateway?

GREAVES: …No. There isn't one.

RAJMATA: Yes.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Anyone on the other side of that wall was going to be killed. This was our last stand. That is what drove us. What drove me. The understanding that I must do what I have to do for my people to survive. Because if I didn't, we wouldn't.

GALANIS: But your people didn't survive, did they? Mamjul is still at the bottom of the ocean, and the Covenant is dead.

[Silence.]

RAJMATA: No. I failed.

GALANIS: We need to know what this thing is. We need to know how it broke you.

RAJMATA: This method of showing you my memories is… a loophole in the laws that I have been bound to. That the Daeva have been bound to. You are seeing more than any living creature in three thousand years has.

GALANIS: I appreciate that, but it's not enough. If this Blackstar still lives, if the god he serves still exists, we need to understand them to be able to defend ourselves.

[GALANIS swallows nervously.]

GALANIS: I have to again pose the idea that I be allowed to commune with… your master.

[Silence.]

RAJMATA: You wish to speak to the Scarlet?

GALANIS: Yes. It's a god, right? It knows the Abominate or the Wretch or whatever. It cast it out to sea. It's the easiest way to learn what we need to know.

RAJMATA: Communing with the Scarlet is a dangerous task, Galanis-hiyar. I have been wedded to it for centuries, and I have only done so a handful of times. To commune is to invite another presence into your mind. To invite a god into your mind… like packing the seas of the world into a pot. The pressure would annihilate you from the inside-out.

GREAVES: But if you have a strong enough pot. A strong enough vessel.

RAJMATA: Perhaps then. But the last time when a man had such fortitude was the founding of our Covenant. I appreciate your struggle, but it is not a possibility.

GREAVES: Fine, okay.

[The RAJMATA clutches her forehead and the dream around the group shimmers.]

GALANIS: Are you okay?

RAJMATA: Yes. Yes. Projecting the dream is just… intensive. I am not as young as I once was.""")

GALANIS: That sounds like a good idea.

[The projection dematerializes, melting into puddles of nothingness that drip off the boughs of the tree. They are still in the canopy of the tree, shaded by the branches. The RAJMATA is supported by a flock of the masked Brides, their horns draped in veils.]

RAJMATA: Goodbye, Greaves-jirras and Galanis-hiyar.

[GALANIS dematerializes out of the astral projection, fading into a cloud of glimmering noise. Lt. GREAVES lingers, staring at the RAJMATA.]

RAJMATA: Greaves-jirras?

GREAVES: What do you think we're doing here?

RAJMATA: What do you mean?

GREAVES: You just told me and the doctor about your sacrifice. About your willingness to do anything if it meant your people would live to see another day.

RAJMATA: What of it?

GREAVES: You failed. But we haven't yet. We might still have a shot at surviving.

[GREAVES points at the RAJMATA.]

GREAVES: We're willing to do whatever it takes. If you deny us access to what we need to save ourselves… it won't just be your own blood on your hands. It'll be ours too.

On May 3rd, the first group of researchers from the Thaumaturgy Division arrived at MKF-01 via helicopter. Due to their unique requirements, the Thaumaturgy Team was quartered aboard the Haffkine with the Psychotronics Division personnel. A meeting of the Research Committee was held shortly thereafter to determine the level of involvement and direction the Team would have. As the Psychotronics Division personnel had successfully mastered the process of inducing projections, SCP-1867 was transported back to Site-19 via the same helicopter as it departed MKF-01.

[GALANIS and GREAVES enter the conference room aboard the Phantom. The research committee is already assembled and waiting. The leads are seated around the conference table, without any aides. SHERIDAN is standing.]

GALANIS: Hello, everyone. Karl and Ajay couldn't join us today, I'm afraid.

[A low murmur of greeting runs throughout.]

SHERIDAN (ARCH): I'd… like to apologize for my behaviour in the last meeting, Dr. Galanis. It was inappropriate, and rude, and I should've voiced my concerns more professionally.

GALANIS: That's… thank you, Dr. Sheridan.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): I still retain my concerns, and I think that we've gotten a little biased in our analysis, but… you know.

GALANIS: Of course. If we're all comfortable with moving on now, we have a new face. Welcome, Dr. Carrick.

CARRICK (THAU): Thank you! Happy to be here.

GALANIS: Is your team settled in?

CARRICK (THAU): As settled-in as one can be aboard a floating tin-can, yes.

[She laughs.]

CARRICK (THAU): No offense to any of you, of course. It's just that we're not a very nautical bunch.

GALANIS: None of us were when the project started. Except Lucian, maybe. I'm pretty sure he was born in the Marines.

[They nudge him, and GREAVES smiles slightly.]

GALANIS: Are you finding our analysis sufficient?

CARRICK (THAU): Not quite, I'm afraid. It's a very solid start, especially for people who aren't thaumaturges, but all thaumaturgy really is is a framework for understanding magic. To understand what drove the Daeva's magic, and how we can utilize and recreate that, would require my team to converse directly with them.

GALANIS: That can be arranged. You should sit down with Crowley from Psychotronics, and arrange tests for your… apprentices? See which ones will have the easiest time getting into Korar.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

CARRICK (THAU): Researchers is fine. And that'll definitely help, but the problem is moreso that… we don't really feel comfortable tapping into spirits for our thaumaturgy yet without a greater understanding of the processes at play. What we'll be able to do without the Daeva is… limited. I'm just trying to set a realistic expectation for you — we're simply not going to be able to do the miracles they were, at least not at first.

GALANIS: That's fine, so long as there's progress.

YIJUN (LING): Oh, that reminds me — Researcher Crowley asked me to pass along a message to you, Doctor. She noticed that the equipment they use in Psychotronics to stabilize and support the astral projections were seeing increased power draw. Something about needing to work harder to keep the projection stable. I don't know what it means, but..

GALANIS: That's… odd. I'll get into it, thanks.

RAMASWAMY (HIST): Speaking of progress, I have looked into the Sea Peoples, as you asked me to.

GALANIS: Find anything?

RAMASWAMY (HIST): Almost nothing. The old files from Amoni-Ram indicate the Middle Kingdom pharoahs were at least aware of the anomalous empires, which might help explain why only a temple in Egypt has any record of their existence. But Amoni-Ram was also conspicously lacking in contemporary sources, and it existed fine.

GALANIS: Gut feeling?

RAMASWAMY (HIST): I do not believe in coincidences, Dr. Galanis. The surviving Mekhanites spread their culture and technology throughout the Middle East and North Africa, but lacked any contemporary source. They only appeared in the Quran as Iram. The Daeva appear to have done the same for Indian culture, taking the role of Kumari Kandam. It stands to reason that this… Three-Prong Army are the kernel of truth behind the myth of the Sea People. They certainly would have had to push through the region on their way to Mamjul and beyond.""")

SHERIDAN (ARCH): I should mention the only thing the mundane archaeological community has ever found related to the Sea People were bronze weapons.

RAMASWAMY (HIST): I do not understand the relevance.

GALANIS: The Rajmata mentions the Blackstar's forces looted Amoni-Ram. And scuffed fuladh looks an awful lot like bronze. It just makes too much sense. Keep looking into it.

RAMASWAMY (HIST): Of course.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): What's up with that name, by the way? Three Prong Army, does that mean anything for the Daeva?

XIJUN (LING): I had the same thought. I looked through the preliminary translation dictionary we've compiled of the oral language — obviously a written one is impossible — and as far as I can tell… nothing. It quite literally just means 'three points'.

RAMASWAMY (HIST): Maybe a descriptor of their military strategy? A three-pronged attack.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): Could be referring to a trident.

GALANIS: That would certainly fit with the Sea People theory. Remind me to ask the Rajmata next time.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): Also on the docket: Thijam. Based on your description of her memories, it seems like it would be an isthmus connection the landmass of — well, I guess we're calling it Kumari Kandam now, to mainland India.

RAMASWAMY (HIST): Isthmuses have historically been of great importance in ancient cultures. Constantinople monopolized trade between the East and West by residing on one. I do not need to tell you how critical the Suez is. It makes sense they would make their choke point there.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): Yeah, but the problem is that we can't find it. We don't even have a very good understanding of what the continent looked like back then, just maps from Amoni-Ram we know are altered and maps from Blackwood's journals that are as likely to be right as they are wrong.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): Permission to speak freely?

GALANIS: I'm not your commanding officer, Levi. Say what's on your mind.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): It feels like we're at a point where we've run out of knowledge to collect. And we're not any closer to finding out our answers.

GALANIS: That's not true, we've learned a lot about the Daeva. What they were, what happened to the world after Amoni-Ram fell.

SHERIDAN (ARCH): I'm an archaeologist, Doctor. I know first-hand what it means to search after knowledge most people will never appreciate, for the sake of nothing but the knowledge itself. But if this Blackstar stuff is still an existential threat… we need knowledge we can apply. And we're not getting that here.

GALANIS: Dr. Carrick is making a great start on applying Daeva magic. That's not applicable.

GREAVES: As the representative from the Council, they're quite pleased with how the project is progressing under Dr. Galanis.

GREAVES: Shooting at rice farmers with AKs to stop the Red Menace isn't doing anything for anyone. Shooting at someone who plans to release and re-capture the lizard to use in his Nazi PMC? Yeah, I feel pretty comfortable doing that.

[GALANIS and GREAVES enter the dream. They are in Korar, standing on the great wall that surrounds the city. The Rajmata, alone and without her handmaidens, her face veiled, stands looking out across the featureless cosmic expanse. Lightning strikes aimlessly in the distance, spiderwebbing acoss the dark sky before fizzling out.]

GALANIS: Greetings, your Grace.

RAJMATA: Look. What do you see?

GREAVES: The astral plane. Emptiness.

RAJMATA: What is it, though? What is the essence of the astral plane?

GALANIS: It's… another layer to reality, right? Superimposed on top of our own.

RAJMATA: Not incorrect, but at once not what I was hoping to hear.

GREAVES: It's a dream.

RAJMATA: Ah. He understands.

[She waves a long, slender hand out.]

RAJMATA: All this was once supported by the minds of everyone in our sister city, when they dreamt. Our existence depended on them, and theirs on us. Now, there is no Mamjul to rely on. Korar rests entirely on the dream of the Scarlet Maharaja.

GALANIS: Your husband.

[She pauses.]

RAJMATA: I suppose. We have no particular word for a male spouse — every relationship in the world is formed of the dominant and the subservient elements. Master, and slave. I am master to my people, and the Maharaja is master to me.

GALANIS: You don't have a conception of gender, then. Interesting.

RAJMATA: Not in the way you would think of it. The physical body is… irrelevant. All our souls rest in Korar, and the form one takes in Mamjul in between reincarnations should not dictate their lot in life.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Surely they have experienced enough lives in enough forms to make any such determination irrelevant. People are what they wished to be. No more.

GALANIS: Interesting.

[Silence for a moment, as the party looks out before the wasteland beyond the walls.]

GALANIS: So are we—

RAJMATA: Yes.

[Distantly, the chanting of the city takes on a different tone. Less wildly harmonious, and more into a somber register. A slower melody, the words so long and deep as to be incomprehensible. At the same time, the view changes. Grass sprouts out of nowhere far below and spreads, trees forming out of nonexistence. The sky goes from star-studded blackness to a deep blue, the sun hanging overhead. Korar melts away behind them, replaced by vast plains, and countless figures crawl out of the dust.]

[In a few moments, they are standing atop the battlement at the Wall of Thijum. In front of them lies a vast, unspeakably large army. Formed into tight regiments, they mass around the base of the wall with siege engines that are not even half the height of the gargantuan barrier. At this height, each soldier is the size of an ant, and the swarm spreads far, far into the foggy distance.]

GREAVES: That has to be… half a million men. Good god. Twice the size of the largest army ever fielded.

GALANIS: Not just them. Turn around, Luce.

[GREAVES turns. On the other side of the wall lies another massive force — not as unfathomably large as the Three-Prong Army, but the Daevic Covenant occupy the vast kilometers of beach between them and the jungle line. They are organized into massive lines, polearms extended to meet a charge. From this height, far to the south, beyond the Daevic Covenant, the huge boughs of the Citadel tree are visible. The wall is the only thing that separates the two forces.]

GREAVES: This has to be that largest battle ever fought. At least a million men, on one battlefield. The mother of all chokepoints.

RAJMATA: Such was my belief.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" That the sheer size of the wall and the army would demoralize them. I was, needless to say, fatally incorrect.

[In fast-forward, the sun sets and drops below the horizon. A scattering of huge bonfires form on both sides of the wall, soldiers gathering around them. The siege engines have been disassembled — the attempts at scaling the wall are obviously pointless. Instead, they are reassembled into a collection of trebuchets, catapults, and ballistas, all aimed at the top of the wall. With large, heavy booms, their payloads of huge stone boulders and explosive tar collide with the battlements. Daeva soldiers huddle behind the stone barriers as the wall shakes with every impact. Shakes, but holds firm, hour after hour, night after night, as they return fire with their own weapons of war and sorcerers.]

RAJMATA: I underestimated the interminable nature of human persistence. I thought they would realize the wall was impenetrable. Not just physically — I sealed it myself, with a ward wrought in blood.

GALANIS: Blood sacrifices are common in your magical school. What's so special about this one?

RAJMATA: They are. But the more powerful the sacrifice, the stronger the magic. [Pause] I rest comfortable in the knowledge that my children would have been slaughtered regardless of whether the horde broke through.

[Silence.]

GALANIS: You… killed your children?

RAJMATA: Seven bodies, seven wards, seven chains to protect the Scarlet Maharaja from those that would seek to destroy him. Their souls belonged to Korar, to him. I simply did what he commanded, and released their physical form with the same dagger I was anointed with.

GALANIS: The black dagger KHAN team found in the throne room. That's why it survived when nothing else did.

[Silence.]

RAJMATA: Their flesh, so sweet, so innocent. The ultimate sacrifice for the ultimate protection.

[Suddenly, she turns and spits on the stone wall.]

RAJMATA: And look now.

The wall continues to be battered, and stand firm. The vines and toxic clouds and poisoners falling from the walls collide below, thinning out the Blackstar's forces, before they are immediately crowded out and replaced.

RAJMATA: Their master arrived.

A full moon hangs overhead in the smoky sky. He disappears into a tent.]

GREAVES: What the hell is that thing? Every time I look at him—

GALANIS: It feels like my brain is boiling.

GREAVES: Yeah. Like he can see me.

RAJMATA: Most magicians in this world are simply that — magicians. Sorcerers, warlocks. People who have a particular leaning towards the esoteric arts and have studied years to apply them to perform even the slightest magic. He… is something else. The world itself shapes around him.

GALANIS: Oh, shit. A reality bender.

[Ahead, the bright whiteness of the full moon over the battlefield is fading as it blackens. It sinks low, a dark star in the sky, blackened and scorched, surrounded by a corona of white light, burning like the eye of a great dead god. After some time, the sun rises, but the moon remains locked in place, hovering over the horde. The tides of the sea malform, twisting and turning, rising and falling in different directions.]

GALANIS: I feel… sick to my stomach. Like I'm going to vomit.

RAJMATA: Yes. This is the Wretch. Primarch of chaos, lord of disorder. Where it goes, the natural laws that govern us fail. Once, the Mekhanites accused us of being wild people. In a sense they were right, but even in the most untamed wilds, a natural harmony emerges. Survival of the fittest, domination of the meek, the cycle of life. That is what the Scarlet embodies.

In the middle of the astral projection, a sudden and unprecedented equipment failure occurred in the Psychotronics Lab aboard the Haffkine. The projection lost connection, and several pieces of equipment were heavily damaged. Doctor Galanis awoke unharmed, but for unknown reasons, Lieutenant Greaves remained unconscious and in the fugue state; an hour later, he slipped into a coma.

The immediate assessment by Psychotronics Division personnel and medical personnel aboard the Phantom was that the LSAP Array embedded in Lt. Greaves' brain resulted in some kind of adverse reaction to the psychic backlash, or was in fact the cause thereof. Before any decision could be reached on moving him to the infirmary, or extracting the Array from his brain, the Array reactivated despite no longer being attached to any discernable power source. The transcript printer it was attached to begin printing a large amount of nonsense text with no clear meaning or purpose, and extremely faint delta waves were detected from Lt. Greaves in an EKG.

Per Dr. Galanis' orders, the Haffkine was temporarily quarantined. Reentry into Korar was not possible until replacement components for the damaged equipment were rush-ordered from the nearby MKF-02 and delivered via helicopter to the ships. Due to the time-sensitive nature of the project, typical Foundation practices to obscure logistical transportation were ignored.

GALANIS: Yeah. Yeah, okay.

[They are standing where they had been before the projection dematerialized: on the wall of Thijum, overlooking the vaste horde of the Three-Prong Army. But time is frozen — the sheets of rain hang in the air, trembling. The surf of the rough waves is frozen in mid-splash. But despite the stillness, it is not silent — drums beat through the air, far, far louder than ever before. The voices making up the chorus are high and strong, reaching a loud peak as they sing out from every direction. The RAJMATA and GREAVES stand overlooking the tableau. He turns.]

GREAVES: Pandora!

GREAVES: What happened? You just vanished. It's been hours.

GALANIS: Lucian, it's been… three days.

GREAVES: I don't understand.

GALANIS: There was an accident. An equipment failure in the lab. It pulled us out of the projection but… you didn't wake up. You slipped into a coma. And the Array kept outputting nonsense text, stuff about dreams and waves and the sea.

GREAVES: I'm in a coma?

GALANIS: It's okay. Calm down. We're gonna wake you up.

RAJMATA: Not yet.

RAJMATA: The failure of the projection was not a failure of your equipment, Galanis-hiyar. The dream… Korar has been splitting apart, failing, fraying at the edges of our great tapestry.

GALANIS: What does that mean? This is the Maharaja's dream, isn't it?

RAJMATA: And he was able to support us, quietly worshipping him, for three thousand years. We had a balance — a harmony formed of primal violence. And your arrival has upset it. Upset him.

GALANIS: Well, we didn't mean—

RAJMATA: Your intentions do not matter now, I'm afraid. The dream is collapsing. Leave now, and there will be no Korar for you to return to. The secrets of the Daeva will go with us to whatever lies beyond paradise.

RAJMATA: There is no body willing to take the interminable burden of being the Maharaja, the Dreamer. A Daeva cannot do it — we need one of the Covenant. A human. The Maharaja's physical body has long since rotted into dust, at the bottom of the sea. There is no one.

GALANIS: We'll find a different way. Lucian—

GREAVES: No. We have to listen.

RAJMATA: He knew he could not take the wall. So he broadened his scope. Like the animal that sees he cannot drag home the carcass, and resolves to consume it all then. His god was thrown into the sea, and spent a thousand years crawling back up to land. Only to turn around and do the same to us.

[The waves on either side of the Isthmus crash again, this time substantially higher. The army looks to their sides and again tightens, only for the waves to grow even higher. The forces at the rear begin a retreat, one that quickly turns to a rout. The army rushes back even as the water rushes forth from either side, drowning the base of the wall.

Terrified, confused screaming fills the air as civilians, slaves, and soldiers run in every direction, attempting to escape to higher ground that does not exist. Mothers carry their babies, or are forced to leave them behind by the shoving of the crowd. Sorcerers rush to the battlements but find their abilities useless against the raging sea. Some citizens even raise their swords to slit their own throats, secure in their future in Korar. Throughout all this the dream is strange, fragmented. It sounds and looks as through passed through a thousand filters, breaking apart the image and putting it back together again. In front of the group lies a grand, marble-panelled building.]

RAJMATA: Destroying us was not enough for the Blackstar. No, where the Mekhanites had ignored him until it was too late, we fought back. We held back the horde. For this affront, for daring to stand against him, he was not content to destroy us. He had to annihilate us.

The primal knowledge of what was before and what will be, the natural law written millions of years before any life existed. It is infinitely complex, and at once deeply simple. I see everything. The precipice we are on, and the brink we are falling towards. Our universe, severed from the others, utterly alone.

I see Aram in his throne room in Amoni-Ram, augmented beyond any spectre of humanity. His eyes glitter with foresight and fear: he sees what I do. He is terrified of it.

I see the Blackstar, sitting alone in a forgotten city on a forgotten island. A paper lies in front of him, and the weight of eras rests on his face.

As witnessed by Vaslirasirraj-Shirat, Seventh Rajmata of the Scarlet Maharaja.
And after the waves crested over the spires and palaces of Mamjul, and brought the city low, and slew in one fell wave the Covenant, then for a time, Mamjul rested, alone and rent, at the bottom of the sea. And there it lay, as the BLACKSTAR marched onwards, through the center of Asia, against the forces of the Nälka, and took the world into a great silence.

And there it continued to lie, unaware of the events beyond the waters, until the ruins of the once-great were happened upon by an old enemy, one who had forgotten its own past. And such were the Daeva immortalized in the pages of the document, defiant of their prison of nonexistence. And in this way, the Song of the Daeva began to write itself once more.

SECOND COVENANT
ATTACHED TRANSCRIPT - MAY 2003

OVCOM: Satellite 15 of the Atreus Array is approaching your location, Phantom. ETA six minutes.

PHANTOM: I don't know if we have that much time.

[A large amount of the security personnel have been killed, and their corpses litter the deck. The Mekhanites are nearly at the bridge, only held back by the few remaining personnel and Alpha-1 operatives, who huddle behind the barricades.]

PHANTOM: Something's happening. We're getting — what the hell?

[The deck of the ship rumbles again. This time, the force is coming from below.]

OVCOM: Sitrep, Phantom.

PHANTOM: Subaquatic monitoring equipment is giving abnormal readings, I don't—

[The ship shudders. For a moment, the Mekhanites pause their advance.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" In the center of the three ships, a circle of red light begins to form in the water, perhaps 10m across. It steadily increases in brightness and intensity.]

PHANTOM: What is that?

[A single figure, wreathed in fire, breaks through the surface of the sea, immediately boiling the water around it to vapor that sprays outward. It rises into the air, a blur of red shooting up to twice the height of the Phantom and moving until it is hovering over the deck.]

PHANTOM: Visual contact. A red-skinned nude figure, flying above the ship.

OVCOM: Mekhanite?

PHANTOM: No. No, it doesn't appear to be. It's not wearing any armor — or anything, actually, and I don't see any augments. It's glowing, though. A corona of red light. The Mekhanites stopped — they're just staring at it.

[The figure reaches one hand out of the corona of light, waving it across the dozens of Mekhanites on the deck of the Phantom. The vines left abandoned by the Thaumuturgy Division suddenly engorge with thorns and violently outstretch, far more aggressive than they were. They wrap around the torsos of a slew of the Mekhanites, pulling them to the ground, burrowing through their eye sockets and mouths into their bodies, tearing them apart from the inside, leaving pools of viscera and blood-soaked augments.]

[The remaining Mekhanites turn their weapons on the floating figure, barraging it with spears, rifles, and conventional firearms. Several of the flying units take to the air, making a run at it. It lazily waves another hand. They stop in midair, clutching at their implants. The bare skin where their augments are attached turns yellow, then green, then black, rotting in real time. It oozes with pus and disintegrates, the dead tissue tearing away from the living, their implants going with it, and their limbless torsos fall screaming into the sea.]

[It turns its attention to the handful of remaining hostiles. They are preparing a retreat, about to leap over the edge of the ship and back into the sea.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" Some even make it, but they do not survive the fall — their bodies split apart, vines and roots forming from inside them and tearing through their skin and flesh as they force an exit. Many are simply bisected, their bloody halves falling into the sea and sinking, turning the water red with blood as it pools around the ships. The battle is over; in the course of 40 seconds, the figure has eviscerated over a hundred Mekhanites.]

PHANTOM: It just… killed them.

OVCOM: Sitrep, please.

PHANTOM: It massacred them. The Mekhanites are all dead. No further friendly casualties. It just brutalized them.

OVCOM: Treat as hostile, Phantom.

[The figure begins to descend from its hovering position. It becomes clear that it is essentially a disembodied nervous system wrapped in a translucent red layer. As it descends, it begins to take firm shape — bones grow, muscles knit themselves into place, though the figure never grows skin. Standing well over 3m tall and with large horns on its head, its skin is inscribed with symbols and markings that pulse to an inaudible rhythm. As it reaches the deck of the Phantom, MTF Alpha-1 operatives fan out from behind cover, supported by security personnel. They surround the figure in a circle, guns drawn and all pointed directly at its head. It does not react.]

PHANTOM: Wait.

OVCOM: What?

[The figure looks up, raising a hand in greeting.]

WILCOX: …Lieutenant Greaves?

The figure, temporarily designated SCP-001-KING, surrendered to security forces and was detained in a secure holding cell aboard the Phantom. Interrogations were a failure; it insisted on speaking first to Doctor Pandora Galanis. Dr. Galanis was brought into the secure cell four hours after they awakened from their astral projection and were debriefed.

The Daeva are not morally pure, and letting a culture with the morals of 3000 years ago out into the modern world is…. obscenely careless.

Per O5 Edict #2130 and with a majority vote of the Overseer Council, the Daevic Empire has been designated GoI-019 and classified as an ally of the Foundation.

Additionally, the Foundation and the Daevic Empire entered into a formal Covenant; a mutually-beneficial anomalous agreement binding both sides to each other. This Covenant is contingent on several factors, and may be broken off if either party feels it has been wronged or betrayed.

The Daevic Empire will surrender knowledge on thaumaturgy that is capable of being utilized against hostile threats.
The Daevic Empire will remain in the astral plane, and make no attempts to forcibly breach through to the material plane.
The Daevic Empire will not intentionally expose their existence, the Foundation's, or the anomalous to non-Veil societies.
In return:

The Foundation will act as the human arm of the Covenant, affecting the material plane in the stead of GoI-019.
A small number of personnel will be permitted to become temporary hosts of Daeva, thereby significantly escalating their thaumaturgic ability.
Additionally, as the Daevic Empire has been ontologically scrubbed from baseline reality by the Blackstar, the Foundation will take a leading role in restoring them. While they will not be given physical form, interviews with Daeva and the Rajmata indicate that the presence of a physical, written record of the Daeva's history will significantly stabilize Korar and begin restoring the vast historical records in Mamjul and across the Indian subcontinent that were obliterated by the Blackstar's damnatio memoriae.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

As their presence in baseline reality retroactively increases, so will the thaumaturgic power they can supply to the Foundation. This effect will apply retroactively — as the document is extended and completed, more ancient artifacts and ruins of the Daeva will be unearthed.

This anomalous effect has been classified as SCP-140, and applied to the current most complete record of the history of the Daeva: this document. Under containment protocol HERODOTUS, SCP-001-JADE has been separated into 5 "acts", each covering, in parallel, a broad period of the Daeva's history from the Song of the Daeva, and the events leading to their rediscovery, and the file has been designated the primary vector of SCP-140. It is recommended for perusal in its redacted forms by all cleared Foundation personnel; as more personnel go through this document, the more the Foundation's thaumaturgic capacity increases.

As the Mamjul-Korar Initiative shifts into its new goals of training thaumaturges in Daeva magic, global Foundation priorities are to be shifted towards the investigation and approval of Thaumiel-class anomalies, particularly those effective in combat applications. Project OLYMPIA has been expedited.

Global Threat Level has once again been elevated to Keneq-5. Project FORERUNNER TRIAD is to dedicate all possible resources to identifying, locating, and securing the final remaining city: the Nälka city of Black Adytum.

ITEM#: 001
LEVEL5
CONTAINMENT CLASS: PENDING

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001, as of documentation, is uncontainable. Containment efforts are focused on research and prevention over direct containment of the anomaly. Site-322's Director Paul Lague is currently heading this investigation.

Foundation personnel are encouraged to participate in contributing to the SCP-001 research project. Director Lague is promoting the divulgence of anecdotes regarding containment failures to be sent to him via SCiPnet. Once enough data is collected, containment efforts will begin.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""

Description: SCP-001 denotes a pervasive anomalous phenomenon affecting the entirety of the SCP Foundation, manifesting as the failure to contain and/or maintain the containment of anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena.

SCP-001 is most commonly observed during the investigatory period of anomalies. A plurality of Foundation investigations conclude with the anomaly in some form of containment. SCP-001 causes the leap from the researching/testing phase of an investigation to the containment phase to be entirely infeasible. This is typically caused by the manifestation of isolated, irregular, and seemingly aimless events that appear to exist solely to prevent the Foundation from achieving containment.

The existence of SCP-001 is based on the logic that the Foundation has access to theoretically infinite manpower, expertise in all subjects anomalous and mundane, powerful reality-warping capabilities, the ability to translocate through the space-time continuum, and access to all anomalous and mundane resources. Despite these fundamental elements of the Foundation’s operations, containment failures still occur at a notably high rate.

While SCP-001 is a theoretical phenomenon, the Foundation experiences a containment failure rate of approximately 5.2%, frequently due to circumstances outside of the Foundation's control. When that collection of incidents is eliminated, containment failures occur at a rate of 4.3%, leaving only SCP-001 as the appropriate explanation for the discrepancy.

Addendum 001.1: SCP-001 Affected Anomalies

Based on Director Lague's research, he has found five incidents for which, based on the circumstances of the containment failures, he hypothesizes SCP-001 to be at fault.

SCP-001-1

        await ctx.channel.send(""" SCP-5770 contains a mind-altering phenomenon causing all persons within a 10-kilometer range to attend the event, despite the lack of advertisement for it.

During SCP-5770, two anomalous entities, SCP-5770-1 and SCP-5770-2, host a stage show in which subjects they deem "sinners" are subject to makeshift punishments akin to what is depicted in Dante Alighieri's Inferno. Both entities resemble animated statues in the style of the Renaissance artist Michelangelo. At SCP-5770's conclusion, evidence of the festival vanishes and attendees lose all knowledge of its events, with the only lasting effect being a notable rise in the attendees' general piousness.

Despite the original SCP-5770 investigation having taken place in 1985, successful containment is yet to be established and, as such, SCP-5770 has been archived and is awaiting official designation.

SCP-001 Influenced Containment Failures

INCIDENT ID: 001.1-01

SCP-001 Effect: The head researcher on SCP-5770, Joseph Pasqua, the former Site-322 Director, deserted from the Foundation due to manipulation by SCP-5770-1. Pasqua was in hiding for over thirty years before being located in Vatican City as part of the Papal Conclave.1

INCIDENT ID: 001.1-02

SCP-001 Effect: During the 1986 investigation, a previously unknown entity self-identifying as "God's Strongest Soldier" manifested on the festival grounds, henceforth SCP-5770-3. It resembled an animated mascot costume of a dove. The entity was approximately 2 meters in height and its form was hollow.

Responding agents of Mobile Task Force ζ-66 ("Guardian Angels") were the first Foundation personnel to interact with the entity.

INCIDENT ID: 001.1-04

SCP-001 Effect: During the 1988 investigation, agents attempted a pacifistic route of cordoning off the entrance to the SCP-5770 gathering place and instituted quarantine orders to city residents. This culminated in a mass of over 100,000 Florentines attacking Foundation personnel in what appeared to be a planned attack. Agents were slaughtered, cannibalized, and their remains were tossed into the nearby Arno River.

SCP-001 Effect: During the 1989 investigation, an invisible barrier manifested at all entry points whenever a member of Foundation personnel attempted to enter. Personnel who managed to enter via a helicopter immediately burst into flames upon touchdown. The helicopter also crashed only three kilometers from Site-322. SCP-5770-3 was seen trampling on the wreckage before flapping its arms, rising into the air, and flying away via unknown means.

Previous Designation: SCP-5594

drysdale.jpg
Andrew Drysdale.

Truncated Description: SCP-5594 is a ritual practice taking place every 35 years in a cordoned subbasement of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The ritual surrounding SCP-5594 is a snail race taking place between six snails, each corresponding to a different aspect of Earth or the universe (space, memory, time, elements, geography, and morality, respectively). Upon the culmination of SCP-5594, baseline reality would be permanently altered based on the winning snail.

Before each SCP-5594 event took place, a random male of the Earth's population would be designated as the race's observer and forced to Egypt by a manipulative, incorporeal force. Following the completion of SCP-5594, all memory of the event would be wiped.

SCP-001 Effect: The snail affecting memory, SCP-5594-2, won SCP-5594, leading to it altering reality to make the Foundation forget about discovering SCP-5594. The in-draft 5594 file was deleted soon after along with all interviews with Drysdale and previously researched information.

It was later discovered that these same series of events had taken place at least four previous times with three other Site Directors; the Foundation has been in a constant loop for at least one hundred years of discovering SCP-5594 and attempting to file and contain it, only for SCP-5594-2 to win and erase all knowledge of the anomaly's existence from the Foundation.

Through the use of an Exclusionary Site, the Foundation was able to recover footage of the second known incident. It showed all snails, save for SCP-5594-2, refusing to participate in the race and allowing SCP-5594-2 to win uncontested.

Truncated Description: SCP-5479 is Gorilla Marketing LLC, a business operated by various species of Great Apes. Advertisements promoting SCP-5479 appeared on various web pages beginning on an unknown date in May 2015.

Each advertisement contains a phone number and an image of an ape or primate. When the phone number is contacted, the caller will be greeted by a robotic female voice, which will request payment for an unspecified item. After payment details are given, the phone call will immediately conclude and an anomalous item will instantaneously appear in the vicinity of the caller.

These items, designated SCP-5479-B, have a variety of violent effects on the user, commonly turning the user into a disproportionate human-ape amalgam before killing them.

SCP-001 Influenced Containment Failures

INCIDENT ID: 001.3-01

SCP-001 Effect: Upon publishing the SCP-5479 file for peer review, researching doctors Randall House and Paul Lague were met with an extreme, emotional backlash from the entirety of those who read the file. This began a sweep of anomalously influenced mass hysteria across the ranks of the Foundation, leading to House and Lague going into hiding for a period of time. The mob lasted for three days, and caused 3.2 million dollars in damages. Below is a truncated list of incidents caused by SCP-5479's publishing:

House and Lague's offices were raided, the mob later flooding and then burning the spaces;
Parts of Site-666 and Site-322 were razed by various mobs;
One unknown person managed to find the hiding locations of Lague and House.""")
        await ctx.channel.send(""" They proceeded to stand outside of the room, monotonously repeating the phrase "humans are apes" before collapsing from exhaustion and being removed;
The mob managed to tame a troop of chimpanzees, which was used to damage more property;
The Overseer Council ordered House and Lague's death by drawing and quartering;
Two factions formed among the mob, one that wanted to use the chimps to "sniff out the bastards" and the other half who believed it was aligning with the enemy. This led to a minor civil war among their ranks with over 1,300 dead or wounded.
O5-1, the only member of the Overseer Council not to have been affected by the hysteria, ordered the file to be deleted. This event occurred prior to any containment efforts on the anomaly, as the peer review process would have been used to judge the best method of containment.

Upon deletion, all persons returned to a normal state. Amnestic stores were dispersed to all affected personnel save for Lague, House, and O5-1 in order to ensure the file would never be published again.

The file was placed on a quarantined server that only Lague, House, and O5-1 had access to. Numerous memetic and cognitohazard tests were performed on the text and images, finding no clear explanation for why the file had such an adverse effect on its readers.

INCIDENT ID: 001.3-02

SCP-001 Effect: The server hosting the original SCP-5479 file randomly ceased operation eight hours after it was uploaded. When a repair of the hardware was attempted, the internal mechanisms of the server had been replaced by fourteen Rhesus Macaque monkeys wearing appropriate-sized Foundation uniforms.

Luckily, a copy of the file was stored in a personal thumb drive belonging to House. It also quickly ceased operation not long after the server did. When the plastic casing was opened, the remains of three Silverback Gorillas erupted from the drive.

INCIDENT ID: 001.4-02

SCP-001 Effect: On August 4, 2016, Site-322, which is situated on a waterfront, was bombarded by ten thousand crustaceans wielding appropriately-sized firearms. At least ten instances held banners depicting silhouettes of a crab and lobster grasping claws. A majority of the entities were nonviolent unless provoked.

Site-322 was wholly unprepared for a surprise attack of this magnitude. All instances appeared to have a singular goal in mind: freeing the contained SCP-5244 instances, which they succeeded at doing. It was determined that the casualties that would have occurred as a result of mounting a defense would have been too extreme given the circumstances.

The present whereabouts of this collection of crustaceans has yet to be discovered by the Foundation, nor have there been reports from the public regarding SCP-5244. It is assumed that the group has relocated.

Does it make sense that a bunch of snails with incomprehensible abilities are doing one of the most menial, useless things imaginable? Does it make sense that I'd be strung up like a disgraced dictator over apes? Does it!?

Hoover: We don't have an answer for any of those at the moment.

Lague: So… figure it out.

O5-2: We all have a Telekill plate in our heads, Six. Sit down.

O5-6: You're all angry at something. What is it?

O5-2: I'm an angry person. Sit down.

Lague: The problem arises when the unexpected occurs. Now, that's not to say we don't know how to handle the unexpected, it's more when it's blatantly, randomly unexpected with the outcome being our failure to contain and, occasionally, document. This anomaly, let's be honest, is very mundane. We analyzed a few, and boom, normal crab. Same behavioral pattern we'd expect from crabs, just with a slight anomalous quirk that's mild. Especially taking the full scope of our jobs into consideration.

O5-7: i was typing and i was rudely interrupted by the witch. i think your spiel is obfuscating from the fact that if you replace the word "unexpected" with the word "underestimated" it means the same thing, paul. anomalies are anomalous and do anomalous things. it happens.

Lague: To the degree displayed here, though?

O5-5: Hi again, Mr. Lague. I'm on the same train of thought as Mr. Sev— Seven is here. They put it better than I can. That's all I had to say and thank you for the wonderful presentation!

O5-13: I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOUR SPIRIT TO BE IRREPARABLY SHATTERED, FIVE.

Lague: Containment breaches operate within the window of the full extent of the anomalies' understood capabilities—

O5-2: You clearly didn't understand those full capabilities. Mr. Lague, is this proposal about an anomaly, or your inability to get over the past?

SCP-4639's self-proclaimed "best portrait."

Truncated Description: SCP-4639 was an incorporeal force that possessed Site-322 Researcher John Azniok on December 11, 2016. SCP-4639 claimed to be the mythological Kraken in search of "a worthy vessel.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""" It was capable of speech through the form it possessed.

Immediately after possession, a number of growths appeared on Azniok's form, resembling black and purple tentacles. Within 20 hours, Azniok was enveloped in these growths. Despite this, Azniok appeared to have the entity under control for a time. This was a fruitless endeavor, as seven days later, Azniok was slowly overtaken by SCP-4639.

SCP-001 Influenced Containment Failures

For a sentient/sapient humanoid anomaly, a number of protocols needed to be fulfilled before full containment could be enacted. At the time, Director Lague was also floating the idea of what is today known as the Integration Program. As such, SCP-4639 was deemed a candidate for a beta test of the working methods. Below are truncated transcripts from the discussions between Site-322 staff and SCP-4639:

+ Open Transcript +
INCIDENT ID: 001.5-01

SCP-001 Effect: SCP-4639 was initially held in a standard humanoid containment chamber, as it was believed a majority of Azniok's anatomy was intact. This was proven to be false, as SCP-4639 managed to escape through a gap between the door and the floor. It was quickly recaptured and sedated. An examination of SCP-4639 found that the human form of Azniok had been converted into the mantle and fins seen on squids.

INCIDENT ID: 001.5-02

SCP-001 Effect: Tropical storm localized solely on Site-322 formed. It rained a number of objects, ranging from seawater to living sea life such as sharks, penguins, and squids. SCP-4639 claimed this was "patronage."

INCIDENT ID: 001.5-03

SCP-001 Effect: As time progressed, SCP-4639 gained a number of anomalous capabilities. These included:

Highly-effective manipulation tactics;
The ability to summon raging storms;
Control of sea life;
Limited omnipotence.
SCP-4639 utilized a combination of these abilities to escape Foundation containment.

SCP-4639 used the above phrasing on all Foundation personnel who attempted to prevent its escape. Recontainment efforts were initiated following this incident.

The entity was quickly tracked due to its "shedding" a number of tentacles as it made its escape. This trail led to Site-322's docking area, where the corpse of SCP-4639 was discovered. The cause of death was deemed to be asphyxiation due to drowning.

Post-mortem dissections found that while a majority of Azniok's external anatomy was converted, his internal organs were still in the process of transforming from human into squid.

Lague: I try my best to keep my composure, can we all agree on that?

Murmuring among the crowd.

Lague: I like to think of all of us at 322 as a family. And, as a family, you'll be treated with respect.

Pause.

Lague: So, with that in mind. I'm going to speak to you as my family. We have a problem — a major one. I'm sure all of you know what I'm talking about. I've even spoken to the Overseers, and they're even more unhappy with the state of things around here. They're actually launching an investigation. You know, they may have some questions for someone who, I don't know, gets mind-tricked by a bundle of tentacles.""")

Coix: You think I — we did this deliberately?

Lague: No! But let's take a look at the last three years. The snails? House and I had to hide in a pocket dimension for a week over some bullshit monkey ad! That assfucking that was the crabs and the lobsters? Don't even get me started on the festival we've made no progress on in fifty years! And now… this! This!? The simplest thing and we lose it!

Lague: How so?

O5-2: Look, I already said it and so did a few of my fellow council members, but I'll reiterate. I don't think this is about containment failure. This is a pattern of personal failure due to something totally mundane: underestimation. You were new. It's a hard job, I know, and look at you now.""")

O5-2 A majority of these occurred in late 2015 into early 2016, just as you became director, right?

Lague: Of the examples I've given, yes.

O5-2: I could genuinely explain almost all of these as accidental negligence from a series of anomalies we didn't fully understand. Let's take the snails. You admitted they're intelligent but they're clearly even more intelligent than you or anyone had assumed, and they're definitely using their abilities to make sure they stay undiscovered and undocumented for as long as they can. I'm not seeing an anomaly, I'm seeing growing pains.

Lague: Well—

O5-2: Or the ape phone number — whatever it was called. Something else is seriously going on with these anomalies that you and whoever was researching with you didn’t expect, and you sadly had to pay the consequences for it. But, didn’t you learn something from every one of these?

Lague: Maybe not consciously but, yes, I did.

O5-2: Have you had an incident similar to the five you've presented since 2016?

Lague: Not to my knowledge, no.

O5-2: Couldn't this all be explained by you getting into a role you felt ill-equipped for and making a few mistakes? What was it? Three years from joining 322 to being a director. I’m pretty sure that’s a record. It's been six years and you've had nothing of the sort since. Growing pains.

SCP-001-6
Designation: SCP-001-LAGUE

SCP-001 Influenced Containment Failures

INCIDENT ID: 001.6-01

SCP-001 Effect: During preliminary research into SCP-001-LAGUE, Director Paul Lague became extremely ill. Medical examinations found that Lague had a number of parasites in his system including Hookworm, Tapeworm, Roundworm-induced toxocariasis, and Whipworm.

INCIDENT ID: 001.6-02

SCP-001 Effect: The server hosting the draft SCP-001-LAGUE proposal was located in Site-7's pocket dimension. Despite being an exceptionally outage-proof server farm, the upload of SCP-001-LAGUE seemingly caused the first and only large-scale blackout in Site-7's history, culminating in the deletion of a single document: Lague's draft.

INCIDENT ID: 001.6-03

SCP-001 Effect: Following the creation of a later draft, SCP-7525-EX manifested at Site-322. This was the anomaly's first appearance since 2020 and it immediately went dormant once again following the incident. Instead of following its normal pattern of corrupting unused SCP file slots, SCP-7525-EX solely targeted the research material of SCP-001-LAGUE.

INCIDENT ID: 001.6-04

SCP-001 Effect: Lague pivoted to using physical drafting over digital due to the above issues. During the second drafting stage, SCP-423 inserted itself into the documentation and refused to exit, stating that "[it] really likes this one." SCP-423 is contained at Site-19 and has not been transferred to another Site since its initial containment.

INCIDENT ID: 001.""")
        await ctx.channel.send("""6-05

SCP-001 Effect: During draft attempt five, Lague hosted all documentation and research material in a hermetically sealed containment chamber. The entrance hall leading into this room contained an airborne antimeme preventing those that attempted to enter to forget the room existed, save for Lague.

During a Chaos Insurgency raid of Site-322, this room was the sole target of a bombing, and all research materials were lost. No other structural damage was sustained.

INCIDENT ID: 001.6-06

SCP-001 Effect: Lague lost the ability to speak or write in any language for one week.

INCIDENT ID: 001.6-07

SCP-001 Effect: The draft was finally completed after Lague was given asylum in The Wanderer's Library. After alerting the Overseer Council to the file's completion, Lague was given transport to Site-01 to the presentation the next day, where the following occurred:

The jet transporting Lague was struck by lightning eight times and had to make an emergency landing after both engines exploded due to apparent mechanical issues unrelated to the lightning;
This landing was near Site-43, where Lague was given refuge until the Site's Acroamatic Abatement system, three containment halls, and a cafeteria collapsed after Lague's entrance to each Section;
Lague opted to drive himself to Site-01 in a disguised Foundation van so as to not put others in danger. A humanoid entity, who Lague claimed was SCP-5770-3, appeared in the middle of a long stretch of road. Attempting to swerve out of the way, Lague crashed into a boulder and totaled the vehicle. The humanoid was not found;
At this point it was 2:00 AM. Lague attempted to radio for support via the van's communication system. Upon pushing the call button, the system ejected what appeared to be a mix of blood, seawater, and fryer grease;
The van's autonomous driving system went online without Lague triggering it.""")

Lague made the rest of the journey on foot, arriving ten minutes late to his SCP-001 proposal presentation at Site-01.
O5-1: Okay, Paul, why the hell wasn't this the first thing we saw?

Lague: Dramatic flair. I wanted to prove it without a doubt.

O5-5: Mr. Lague— Paul. Can I call you Paul? Okay, Mr. Lague. Even if this has been my first proposal presentation it's definitely my favorite!

O5-13: I PRAY TO GOD HE STRIKES YOU WHERE YOU SIT.

O5-4: It's hard to argue all of this. I actually heard about the jet's engines, but not the lightning. And 43? Why weren't we told about this?

O5-1: Something's always happening at that clown show.

O5-4: And the car?

Lague: It's been six hours since that happened. My cell service wouldn't work during the trip. When I got here I tried to send an email but my inbox filled with spam overnight and I didn't have enough storage to send anything. That's probably another one. Call it seven point five.

O5-1: Can you give us your explanation of what happened here?

Lague: The 001 itself didn't want to be filed and potentially contained. It seems to be a self-preservation tactic at this point. If I can ask again, have you ever denied an 001 proposal after giving someone the opportunity to research and present one?

O5-6: I don't need to read your mind to see that you already know the answer.

Lague: Flip the papers over, please.

INCIDENT ID: 001.6-08

SCP-001 Effect: In a historic decision, the Overseer Council votes to deny filing an SCP-001 proposal.

 
 

The Overseer Council has approved this proposal. Proceed?

Addendum 001.3: Update

Following Site-322 receiving a swath of SCP-001 anomalies, Lague organized a meeting of his most trusted colleagues, containment supervisors, and general Foundation personnel to discuss updated containment procedures for SCP-001. A meeting of over one hundred Foundation staff took place, with discussions ranging wildly in perspective. A consensus landed on testing out a hypothesized method of containment proposed by Dr. Blank of Site-43 and Director Lague. Testing was successful, and Lague drafted the below containment procedures the next week.

Updated Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is contained through the combined efforts of Foundation personnel. Staff who discover SCP-001-affected anomalies will flag their research material, note any suspicious incidents, and send their findings to a collection of the Foundation's containment experts selected by Director Paul Lague. These experts will review all content, point out inconsistencies, and identify potential errors.

The next phase of containment will focus on the factors that led to the SCP-001-induced incidents and attempt to pinpoint a vector of containment. When this vector is discovered, containment will once again be attempted.

Preliminary tests have found these containment procedures to be 95% effective in combatting SCP-001.""")
